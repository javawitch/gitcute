Welcome to the git cute podcast. Today we are going to be talking about coding boot camps. Yay. Stay tuned.

Jocelyn (00:20):
Hi. It has been a very, very long time. I'm glad y'all have stuck it out with me through the past few weeks where I've just been trying to gather myself and get myself back into a state the where I am productive and organized. And now I'm back to talk all about coding boot camps. First of all, I just want to say thank you to everyone. Even through my abscence that left five star reviews and ratings for me on Apple podcasts and Spotify. I really appreciate it. It helps me out so much. It lets me know that recording this podcast was the right thing to do and I cannot thank yâ€™all enough so thank you. Okay. Disclaimer time. In this episode I'm obviously talking about coding boot camp and it is no surprised that I went through a coding boot bootcamp to get into the industry as a software engineer. With that said, I will not be naming what bootcamp I went to for a lot of personal reasons.

Jocelyn (01:23):
But the main reason being I am doing part one, a coding boot camps to teach you how to vet a bootcamp. This is not for me to push a specific bootcamp or specific language or framework down your throat. That's just not how I do things. So it's just not going to happen. I'm not going to be giving that information. So if that was something that you were looking here are listening to this episode or to find out where I've went it's just not going to happen. I'm going to be giving you very general advice for bootcamps as a whole and I hope you understand that. So could coding boot camps. So im going to start it off with my backstory. My backstory is that three years ago I was a office manager for a new construction company in Delaware. I was severely underpaid and I hated it there.

Jocelyn (02:18):
My work was very mundane and boring at this time, that same year my father had just died in February, so I was in a terrible mental state, depressed, aF financially, just struggling. My best friend Kelsey. Hey Kels. Probably like, why am I in this episode? She happened to be getting to a point where she was automating her job, like the genius that she is and she was teaching herself sequel super database management and she was looking into coding boot camps to kind of expand for knowledge, help her do her job more efficiently. Kelsey was actually one of the first students in the coding bootcamp and I want to say maybe five to six weeks in the bootcamp when she had gotten over the hump of the initial shock of how hard it was. She told me that I pretty much had no choice but to apply to side bootcamp because as I said before, I was pretty miserable.

Jocelyn (03:14):
I had just recently got turned down from a promoted position because I was too good at my job as a receptionist, not manager. Needless to say, that was really shitty, so I jumped on the chance to be able to go. I want to slow down and talk about vetting bootcamp. Obviously I did not vet this bootcamp. I had Kelsey vet this bootcamp for me through her experience there, but I want y'all to learn from my mistakes. I'm not saying that my bootcamp was bad at the time I was there. That is completely, not what I'm saying, but I went into that, all gung ho because for me it was a life changing decision regardless of if by was successful after the bootcamp or got a job or not. I was pretty much at rock bottom. So for me I jumped at whatever chance that I thought I could beat i

Jocelyn (04:17):
Are you, I want you to be a little more, a little more, Oh well about your decisions about picking out a bootcamp, it's so important. There are a lot of bootcamps and I believe that that this may be where some of the, the a negative connotation to where coding boot camps come from because there are boot camps out there that are for profit and they take your money, they don't do a great job with teaching and supporting and networking and job placement and then afterwards you're screwed. Or companies are getting entry level developers and they don't have at least the baseline skills that they, I think that the developer would need to succeed in their roles. Questions you should be asking yourself and asking the establishment that you want to go to. How much does it cost? I mean numbers are extremely important. Yeah. When I was choosing my bootcamp or chose it because I didn't look at any others, let's be completely honest, I did not, the cost was $1,000 of my own money that I would need to them after I passed the placement exams in the interviews.

Jocelyn (05:25):
And then after that there was an additional $10,000 balance. However, if I were to get a job with a sponsor company, then after six months of being in that role, the company would pay the $10,000 for me. So essentially all we have to be paying with $1,000. Luckily for me, I was extremely poor array, right? Financial assistance. We actually had a program where I had to submit my w two of the last year and pay stubs to the house or I was and I mean was making under $23,000 a year. So luckily I afforded to not have to give over $1,000 because I did not have $1,000 to give. So essentially I went to my coding boot camp for free, which to this day is fucking amazing. There are different factors that go into cost. Does the price include housing? How far away have you going to be from your home?

Jocelyn (06:20):
Are you going to actually need [inaudible]? Hey there. In my case I was from about, I would say with traffic two hours away from the city where my bootcamp was. So I had no option but to relocate to the city where the bootcamp was for me, that cost did not include housing. I didn't have that. I had to kind of struggle bus my way through accepting donations from friends again, shut out. Do you guys, you know who you are in order to make it possible? Does it include meals? Housing is one thing, meals than another. I did not think this out very well. I was at the bootcamp because I was starving. I want to stay. I probably lost 15 pounds while I was doing the bootcamp. Mainly because a, my caloric intake was extremely below the standard 2000 you would need to maintain weight.

Jocelyn (07:14):
And B, I was walking in least two miles every day to get to my boot camp and from so aye, that was a bad time. I'm very, whenever I go back to the bootcamp to do like mock interviews where when people ask me questions about like, what did she do to survive? I'm like, you guys have, it's so easy now because that we provide staff, they provide meals and I did not have that. I was broke. I don't know how I got through something that mentally straining on site and so little food, I laugh now because at the time [inaudible] very sad. Also including the cost this conducive to your current lifestyle. Are you married? Do you have children? Do you have any other adult like responsibilities that you need or people that rely on you? Okay. All of these things go into the cost of the program, so [inaudible] it's very subjective about how much you are willing to invest. [inaudible] Trusting that your investment is going to, yeah.

Jocelyn (08:22):
Another question for a bootcamp. What is being taught? I feel like a lot of people get caught up on what languages or frameworks are being taught at a boot camp. My bootcamp taught me in Java and JavaScript. With that I learn spring boot. Angular one. Yes, and also ionic. At the time was I concerned about what language I was learning, what frameworks I was learning, what type of job I was going to go into. Absolutely fucking not. I was worried about being able to learn this language, being able to retain this information. That's for me, I think, yeah, it was about a job. I want to say that most people that go into a coding boot camp, you're either trying to beat up self-learning, but at the end of the day, what we want out of this is a job. So for me, I was not that concerned about it.

Jocelyn (09:15):
We'll pass that information onto you. I don't believe that when you're going into boot camp, unless you already have prior programming experience and you already knew I language the language and the framework. Honestly it's not that important. If you're looking to go into a specific track, see it's like machine learning or something like that. I want to say that it's very specialized. Specially when you're starting out as a software engineer and you're just doing yourself a service because it's very possible that you can learn those things on the side while learning [inaudible] something or to have a job so you can eat and have a place to sleep while you're learning machine [inaudible] learning. Look, it's all about money for me. I feel like a lot of software engineers, they kind of, well also the fact that we know software engineering passion and do you need to have a side project and you also need to be contributing to open source and you also need to be doing talks.

Jocelyn (10:10):
You also need to be tutoring in this and that. I'm somewhat making fun of myself because I also still tutor. I still do talk always. I love teaching and talking and obviously I'm doing a fucking tech podcast, but the truth of the matter is most of us we're in it for money and that's okay, but you can also be in it for money and also like and have a [inaudible] [inaudible] right. Well stand their job right over. I have seen a lot of coding bootcamps that tell themselves it's full stack bootcamp. Mainly I believe this is just a marketing ploy because a lot of these have been popping up due to the popularity of the term in the industry. If you've ever been approached by a recruiter, usually they'll say, Hey, we haven't yet great full-stack opportunity for you. For me, I'm a sucker for those type of roles because I like learning everything.

Jocelyn (11:02):
I need to be satiated knowledge-wise or else I get really bored and that is the fastest way to lose me and lose from a company other than being a misogynistic asshole. Some other bootcamps may even use even more coded language like as front end or back end engineer. Usually that's just really dependent on the language and the framework that's going to be taught and then you also need to make sure that along with learning a core ABI oriented language or functional language, please people don't hurt me. Overthink, I'll be oriented. I'm a Java engineer. Please make sure that they're actually giving you HTML and CSS is cupboard because you can't call yourself a software engineer if you don't know HTML and CSS. I'm not saying that you have to be good at it, but you should know it. HTML and CSS or languages too.

Jocelyn (11:47):
You can fight me on that email. All complaints and other choice words to the gate food podcast@gmail.com. What is better overall in terms of embedding a boot camp? Finances and location always come first. For me, again, I'm a terrible example. I pretty much [inaudible] wait with maybe $500 to my name, sold a bunch of my furniture, actually sold all of my furniture, sold my TB. I didn't sell my computer because I'm not completely ridiculous. But if I had the means in the situation to wait and possibly save up more, I would have I feel like on the location side I did pretty well. I was still within my state, my status extremely small. So two hours is pretty much the length between the bottom and the state and the top of the state. So that was fine for me because I still had support if I needed it.

Jocelyn (12:47):
What makes the bootcamp better? Picking the bootcamp that has the better networking and better job opportunities. I cannot stress this enough. I will say that my bootcamp even now so has very strong networking and job opportunities. So it was really important for me to see that there were corporate sponsors for this bootcamp because then I knew that at the end of the bootcamp, well, technically our interview started at week 10. Our resumes were sent out to all PR, the prospect of corporate partners, which means that they were actively looking for people. They actively knew our situation that we were going to be.

Jocelyn (13:26):
They actively knew our situation that we were going to be entry level developers and then they set up interviews for us. I think I had four interviews with [inaudible] companies. Obviously I came out on the other side doing pretty well. I got my first job with JP Morgan chase. Shout out to y'all, but that's extremely important. There are some boot camps that are out here that don't want to give you the time of day after maybe like three months after you've finished your boot camp. And then they're like, okay, go off into the world, do what you gotta do, but also pay me that money. And I feel that's just unacceptable when you're paying thousands and thousands of dollars or something and they're not really helping. You know, I think that's ridiculous to be very careful about that. See if bootcamps to have corporate partners partnerships and then ask them extensively about how they help graduates after with job placement and then bird pick what you like. If you are in, I dunno, California, and you have a great kit of bootcamps and [inaudible] everything about them or is equal on every single level and figure out what language or track that you like and then pick it up from error.

Jocelyn (14:40):
Because as I say, once you learn one language or framework, it will be so much easier to pick up another one. Now maybe it might be a little harder if you hop between ops oriented language and then to a functional programming language because just the methodologies and ideologies are a lot different, but you still be able to pick up certain tasks and things. So don't you worry about it? I have to let people know that bootcamps are meant to tell you the truth, fundamentals to get you up and running in an entry level role. So if you feel as though this is one of the most important things when vetting for a bootcamp, and I cannot stress this enough that you need to talk to people that I have attended recently as in recent graduate and adding this in here because I do have people that are new or they're looking into the bootcamp that I attended and they'll reach out to me on LinkedIn or we'll be at a social event and they'll ask me, what is your experience like or what was your experience like in this bootcamp?

Jocelyn (15:54):
And I have to stay. I honestly don't have anything valuable to tell you about that because typically they're looking for very specific answers. Like, how am I going to handle this teacher? What teachers are the best? What languages did you look [inaudible] learn? So for me, it's kind of just like the way you all have set up for change. You're adding new languages. You completely okay. Like got rid of the book that I used to use. You're using something completely different. You're learning different frameworks. You have different teachers. There's nothing that I, I can give you other than him. Basic survival information, which will be in part two, a boot camp by the way, small plug. And I'm just not useful to source anymore. So that's when I tell them that you need to direct yourself to somebody that's a recent graduate because they'll have [inaudible] a better frame of mind, mind and they'll have, okay.

Jocelyn (16:48):
My shirt it got it. I'm old. So gen two, I'm the gen two. I am, I am the Toga Pete of mine. Oop. You know what? I am the fucking two, the few my boot camp. Okay. Okay. So talk to the people that have attended recently. Go to them. Boot camps, networking event. I will say that it is very cool that my bootcamp does hold networking events for people that haven't actually gotten into the program yet or there they're interested in it. They hold Amies, which I have actually in the past I did a couple of those, but I kinda got cycled out because like I said, I'm [inaudible] so why would I and ask them specifically about how long did it take them to get a job that's so important. And I also want to say that you need a pretty good sample size.

Jocelyn (17:44):
Just don't go asking one person these questions. You need to ask at the minimum three because three constitutes of pattern and then add more to that. So you have a very good sample size of data. How long did it take them to get a job? The quality of the instruction. How does it so important? Because why would you want, Hey, all this money just to know that it's going to be you and your classmates pretty much talking to each other and teaching each other and helping each other out. When the teachers are done their lectures, they don't even bother to come and help you.

Jocelyn (18:18):
How, why would I do that? Why would I tell you to do that? Absolutely. Freaking night. Quality of the materials used. Essentially. What book are you using? When was this book published? What version of the language here are you using? Cause I guarantee you if I went to say I'm betting a coop bootcamp right now, can I ask, so what book are you using? And they say, I don't know, insert some random made up title here. I can't think, but it's it's Java six sweetie. What am I going to do with Java six right now when we're already onto Java 11 what is going to happen at the very least give me job at eight at the bare minimum. Give me Java eight you know what I'm saying? So you need to understand that bare minimum. You may have to do some Googling. If you're not a programmer, you may not with no, that means just know you're looking for a death bootcamp. They say that they're teaching Java stick lack in their face and say there is no possible okay that I'm joining. Just know that what frameworks or practices they're taught that's very effective. Wharton if they're teaching you an old framework or an extremely obscure framework that is not used anywhere within your actual industry girls, that's a no take notes on what those frameworks are or if they even better get it, they don't know that's a red flag. Just it's just [inaudible].

Jocelyn (19:58):
We don't do that. Also ask them how they feel about knowing the basics for their jobs. I mean, like I said before, or the goal of a coding boot camp is to give you the [inaudible] base and knowledge to make you succeed in an entry level position. So ask them how they feel currently in their job. And I'm not saying how they're performing at their job because depending it takes six months to a year to ramp up fully in a role. I'm in a mid level role right now and it took me, I want to stay nine months to ramp up in my role because there's a lot of stuff going on. I'm talking about asking them how they feel they are doing when sitting along other programmers on their team, how they are. I feel they are learning, can they [inaudible] can they grasp these concepts? And it would say yes and the bootcamp is doing a good job. Either that or the person that is being taught. It happens to learn a specific way. But with all those factors in there, that should give you a pretty good idea.

Jocelyn (21:06):
Okay, so this is the end of part one. I ranted a lot. I talked a lot. I think it's extremely important that people understand the finances that go into this because that is one thing is that I just was terrible with aye. I struggled when I honestly didn't need to and I'm doing this episode B so that y'all won't struggle like I did if you liked this episode, if you liked part one of coding bootcamp, please. So that is the end of part one of coding boot camps. If you liked this episode, please feel free to leave me a five star review on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening to this. It helps me out and make sure that other people are able to hear me talk and cuss about technology and give great advice. All right? Yeah. I'm so excited. I'm so glad to be back. This is the best episode for me to come back for a break on Joe. Thank you all so much again, and I will. Okay. Hi.
