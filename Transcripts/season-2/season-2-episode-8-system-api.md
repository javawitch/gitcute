Hi, everyone. Welcome back to get cute and happy. Almost Leo season as a Leo, I am so excited to be really annoying on this podcast. More so than I already am, and the energy is just I'm living for it. Y'all I'm living for it. So before we get into what this week's episode is going to be, although you probably already know it from the podcast title, I just wanted to say thank you again to everybody that has supported me through the sponsorships of this podcast. As you know, you will be hearing ads throughout this podcast. Now, maybe in the future, there may be more ads. Maybe I'll be switching out ads here or there, but I did want to let y'all know that. Thank you for purchasing anything through any of my sponsorship links. It means the world to me because I'm being paid for doing this podcast, which is something I really, really do enjoy, help support me in the podcast so much and will only take this podcast to greater Heights.

Speaker 2 (01:37):
So obviously if you love the podcast, feel free to support me through those sponsors. And then also feel free to leave me a five star review on Apple podcasts or wherever you are listening to this episode. I'm kind of getting away from saying that, but now that money is sort of on the line. I need to start saying that a lot more because the comments and reviews do play into Apple podcast algorithm, which is what drives me up the charts and gets people to see me, which leads to more sponsorships, yada yada, yada. You've heard it on all your other podcasts before, but that would be great of you to do so. This week's episode is going to be all about system and API design. The funny thing is, is that I just saw that ladybug podcast also has an episode out on system design this week, which is really cool.

Speaker 2 (02:28):
So after you listen to my episode, feel free to go on over to ladybug podcasts and to check out their episode as well, because that's just really hilarious. And no, I have not listened to their episode yet because I didn't want to get any ideas. All of this is coming from my mind and from crank cracking the coding interview. Okay. So leave it at that. Now this episode might be long because there is a lot of information that goes into systems and API design and it's a lot is a lot to condense and to get into what a 20 minute episode, maybe 25. I'm not sure. All I know is that API and system design is a very complex thing and I'm going to be trying to break it down into what I can handle and how I approach them in interviews.

Speaker 2 (03:26):
So hopefully this is helpful for you now going onto the resources, because this is very important. It's going to be me going through many, many system and API design interviews this week and over the past month and a half, and then also cracking the coding interview. You'll also be hearing me refer to cracking the coding interview on this episode as CTCI, because honestly, while I love the book, the name is way too long for me to be repeating it. And sometimes it's hard for me to pronounce basic words most of the time in this podcast. So we're just going to try to keep it level, Oh, I almost forgot. In this episode there also needs to be a disclaimer. I am going to cuss in this podcast probably more than likely. Sometimes I don't, but it needs to be here. If for some reason you don't find me cussing okay with you, then by all means, go ahead and unfollow unsubscribe remove the episode from whatever device you are listening to it on because I'm not going to be changing that for anybody.

Speaker 2 (04:31):
And I'm not expecting you to change how you feel for me. So let's just move along and get to episode shadowy today's episode has been brought to you by audible. Audible is a leading provider of spoken word entertainment and audio books ranging from bestsellers to celebrity memoirs news, business, and self development. I've been using it to reread song of ice and fire by George RR Martin. And I'm so glad that I had the audio book version to get through them this time. Instead of having to look down on my phone in a car on lunch breaks all us seven years ago, audible has given gatekeep listeners a free 30 day trial and free audio book. Yes. Free just visit audible trial.com forward slash get cute again. Is it audible trial.com for slash gatekeep today for your free 30 day audible trial? Now let's get back to the episode now among myself and my friends, there's a lot of discourse surrounding cracking the coding interview.

Speaker 2 (05:31):
I personally think this thing is my interview Bible. If you focus on the areas that you absolutely need to, I wouldn't suggest rereading the entire thing before every single interview or before every single time period you need to interview. But if you just look up certain chapters and problems, then it will be absolutely fine. Of course, there were other books that you can supplement for knowledge on things that cracking the coding interview. It doesn't go into in depth fun, but overall it is great with that said McDowell's brief, but informative chapter on system design is scalability. Just so you know, it is chapter nine, which is nine is my favorite number. So of course I'm going to love it anyway, just based on that it's a brief, but informative chapter on systems, Zionist scalability absolutely helped me become more comfortable with system design and helped me with how to tackle API design as well.

Speaker 2 (06:26):
Because that chapter actually doesn't go into API design. So here's the question. Why the hell do they? And they, as in companies want us to know system design anyway, why do they give system design interviews, our entire software engineer? And yeah, you know, I am, you are, however, the higher you get as a software engineer, senior in bow above, usually you are expecting not only to know how to code, you need to know how to architect the system to correctly, identify some failures and how to quickly incorrectly alleviate set system failures. If they occur. When you say it like that, it sounds really complex, but I'm going to keep repeating myself in this episode to say it is really complex because don't give yourself too much trouble. If you don't get it immediately. I absolutely did not get this immediately. I've been studying on and off for let's say a year or so. So the fact that I'm just now comfortable, both comfortable enough now to actually do a podcast episode on this is telling you all that you need to know.

Speaker 2 (07:36):
This is the kind of stuff that I nerd out on a little bit, because it gets into really cool things like security databases, server, construction, load, balancing throughput, latency, all of the things that you should be thinking about when designing a system from scratch, as, as it's mentioned in CTCI the most important thing you need to remember for system API design interviews is that there is no right or wrong answer. This is also a concept that I'm going to be repeating a lot. In this episode, the interviewer wants you to drive the conversation and to see and hear your thought process. Now with the back and forth, that happens in system API design interviews and what I mean by back and forth and meeting the communication between you and the interviewer. It is important that you know how to take guidance from the interviewer as well, because they are there to help you to get a workable design.

Speaker 2 (08:26):
You absolutely do not want to ignore your interviewer. Think of it as an actual working relationship, think of the interviewer on your team. And you're just talking through a problem. You hopefully you're not the type of person. That's just going to ignore feedback from your coworker and keep going on one path, regardless of them, kind of trying to tell you in a nice way that going down the wrong path, don't be that person. We actually want you to get the job here. Let's focus on system design first from the countless interviews that I've had for senior and above positions over the past month or so, I have compiled what the common themes were from those interviews. Of course, I can't tell you what questions I was specifically asked on these interviews for what companies, because NDAs and all that, but it will give you enough information to be able to tackle any problem thrown at you.

Speaker 2 (09:17):
For example, see that an interviewer asks you to do that line. Twitter. That within itself is an extremely vague question. Since Twitter is a highly complex system with a lot of features and those features with a lot of methods to create an overall good user experience from here, you'd want to break down the problem of design Twitter into the smallest pieces possible. Do you see how this is starting to become a theme throughout the entirety of the software engineering thing and generally complex problem solving in general, the whole wanting to break down large complex problems into smaller pieces. There's a theme. There's a reason why a lot of us think this way and then start asking your interviewer very important questions. What features or Twitter would you like me to design? Are we sticking with MVP, which would be sending tweets and viewing tweets on a timeline.

Speaker 2 (10:06):
You don't want to further complicate the problem. So it's best to stick to the bare bones. So you don't have to spend too long trying to design your system. These interviews are typically 45 to 60 minutes long. So you really don't have that much time to get your view across. Also asking questions about the specifics of the system will help you understand how many potential API so we'll be working with and to further identify possible bottlenecks that your system might endure. When designing a system, I start from left to right McDowell mentions, and CTCI the use of the whiteboard, but considering our current climate of in person interviews, not happening, you're going to want to improvise knowing how to draw out a system to the guy. Graham is must have knowledge. You need to know what components of basic system is comprised of before you even think of designing.

Speaker 2 (10:51):
One seems like an obvious thing to know, but you would be surprised about how much people don't think of that when they come into wanting to practice for these interviews, you know, for a fact that you're going to have users accessing the system. Is there some sort of firewall that you want to put between your users and the direct access of your servers that are going to be storing your API APIs? Hint, there is how many servers are you going to want your API to have? How many data sources will these servers with the API have access to? Are there any catching points within your system to make sure your system doesn't bottleneck? What sort of database will work the best with the system? And what are the trade offs between a SQL or a no SQL database? Will your database be heavily read only?

Speaker 2 (11:34):
Or will it be making rights as well? Well, you have more than one database or multiple. This all might seem complex and it is, but it's important that you think about these things. When going through a system design interview for people that already have work experience in enterprise or any other professional setting, these things will come second nature to you. You can easily tie these concepts back to the application that you may have had to work support on. Now, I'm going to take these three points for system design directly from cracking the coding interview. But within the chapter, McDowell goes into a lot more key points, but I found that focusing on these three key points within my interviews, granted to me the most success, the first key concept is horizontal versus vertical scaling. There's only two ways that a system can be scaled vertically and horizontally. And I'm telling you right now that most of the time in my interviews, all of my solutions were horizontally scaled. And that was the correct solution for the time as from a cracking, the coding interview, horizontal scaling means increasing the number of nodes. For example, you might add additional servers, thus decreasing the load on any one server. Now with the ease of cloud computing, it makes it so much easy just to scale up some servers when you're hitting additional traffic.

Speaker 2 (12:53):
The second thing is going to be a load balancer, essentially a load balancer, just to make sure that the load of your system is distributed evenly across all servers. So that way it's not running on one server causing it to crash in order to do this. However, you do need to have clone servers with the exact same access to data and the exact same code. And last but not least kaching kaching is like the key word of the software architecture gods catching is such a fast way to speed up your system. What is catching you ask caching is essentially just a key value pairing. So essentially this is how it happens. Say you're on a website and you go to click on a tablet you've clicked on before and in clicking on that tab grabs a piece of information that you need. Essentially your system will check the catch for the key to that piece of information.

Speaker 2 (13:53):
If the key exists, then it will just return information from that catch versus having to make another API call to one of your API APIs. If it doesn't exist, then of course it would make the call to the API. And this is one of the easiest things to speed of your system. And it's really simple and straightforward.

Put your money in coffee, where your mouth is support black, LGBTQ plus affiliated and owned grinding coffee. Cal. Now back to the rest of the show, typically when you and your interviewer are done going over the system design aspect, and they're satisfied, they will tell you to deep dive into one or two VPs that you have specified within your system that you will need for the system to work. Obviously sticking with the example of designing Twitter, let's say that we have simplified the process by saying that we are just going to focus on the feature of being able to see your friend's tweets in a timeline. Remember in this part to stay relatively high level, when talking about the specs of your API, the important things to focus on in this interview are what objects is this API going to need? And what object is this going to put out the end points of the actual API?

Speaker 2 (15:43):
What parameters your end points are going to take and how many end points will you need to complete what the interviewer is looking for at this time, you're going to look back at your system design and see what other API is. You said you were going to need. And if you're going to need the information from them as well for this specific feature, don't be afraid to ask about possibly adding your system design. If you find that you might need more information that you didn't initially specify, also, don't be afraid to ask for clarification about the specs for this API. Again, this is in an interview that is designed to be vague, and they expect you to not only ask questions, but also to drive the conversation. The interviewer is there as a resource, but they are not going to hold your hand through the process when it comes to defining end points and what those end points are going to do the interview, we'll probably start asking you questions that will lead you down the path towards your goal.

Speaker 2 (16:31):
Remember, there is no right or wrong answer and they absolutely do not expect anything perfect, because there is no such thing as perfect software anywhere, but they do want to make sure that you understand the business use case, how to scope the problem successfully. And if there are any trade offs at your system, design is going to have, as CTCI says, there is no perfect system. Also remember that when you're designing it end point, you want to design under single responsibility. You don't want your end point to do more than one thing. This is where the highly favored Java naming convention comes in name your end point, exactly what it is going to be doing. This will help you figure out what parameters you are going to need to get the result that you want. An example say your end point is retrieved timeline tweets.

Speaker 2 (17:20):
What parameters do you think you need in order to pass the list of tweets, the sexually, perhaps a Twitter user object, maybe some sort of collection of friends that are tied to the Twitter user, but how would they be tied? What sort of scheme are we encountering in our database? These are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself and maybe the interviewer to get to a successful API design. Now you don't need to go too heavy into any database schema unless the interviewers specifically ask you to, but you are going to want to know simple table structures and even joins, and maybe even an ID because that will help you with your API design. Now, I can't say that I have encountered an API design interview where it's sort of asking you framework specifics. An example would be building out a NVC pattern for an end point in spring without, you know, spring boot and say a coder pad.

Speaker 2 (18:14):
So if you do encounter something like that, please email me or tweet me to let me know. So I can mourn with you. And then also talk about how weird that is. I hope that overall this episode gives you some good ideas on how to approach system design and API design interviews. There is still a lot of information. So like I said, I highly suggest you pick up cracking the coding interview. If you don't already have that book in your large collection of programming books, you probably already have, but definitely pick it up. And if I find any other system design or API design books that are relevant, I will leave them in the show notes below. And what'd you look at that? I actually came in at 19 minutes. Hey, it's not that

Speaker 1 (19:02):
It's still kind of long.

Speaker 2 (19:05):
Hey, so as always, if you liked this episode, please feel free to leave me a five star review on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening to this podcast episode. It helps me out a lot and it would be great for you to do that. As always, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to email me, email me@thegetcutepodcastatgmail.com or go ahead and tweet at get cute podcasts. You can also follow me on my personal Twitter, which is at so and so's, but please don't tweet me any podcasts up there because usually I'm dealing with my own sort of thing on that account. And I kind of needed to try to keep them separated just a little bit. Is there anything else that I need to talk about or no, I think that's, I think that's it, which is so weird. Usually have a lot of stuff I have to talk about here. Yeah. Thank you so much for listening to this episode and I will see y'all next week.
