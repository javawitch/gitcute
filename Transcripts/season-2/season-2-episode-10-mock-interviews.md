Jocelyn (00:40):
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Git Cute. It is Jocelyn. And I actually have a lot to talk about before we get into this week's episode. So as always, if you liked the previous episodes or you just like me in general, because you know, it is officially Leo season. We are officially in August Leo season. So obviously the best of the best feel free to leave me a five star review on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening to this, because it does help me out as far as getting ad rules and payment and all of those great things. Now, if you have been listening to me, if you listened to all of my episodes, I typically ask for these reviews and five star reviews, every episode, because I know how important it is to grow. And so finally, instead of just asking, asking, asking for y'all to give me, give me, give me, I decided to give back to you as well.

Jocelyn (01:36):
If you follow Git Cute Podcast on Twitter, which I highly suggest that you do, because I usually post there about these things. First, I am giving away an interview bundle. So I talk a lot about interviews. Actually, this episode is actually going to be about interviews. So once again, and I figured why not give back to the community that has supported me so much with the tools that I love and use and have helped me get to the position of a senior software engineer and yeah, what could be better than that? Really? So I'm going to let you know, what is in the interview bundle, and then I will also let you know what you need to do. So the bundle includes a copy of cracking the coding interview, which we know I love a copy of markings, all algorithms, which is in Python. Again, I love a copy of elements of programming interviews and C plus plus.

Jocelyn (02:35):
Now I have not spoken about this book before on the podcast, whoever my friend Dame did suggest this to me when I was going through the interview process with PayPal and I accidentally bought the C plus plus one, but I needed the Java one. So the Java one is with me. But for those of you that know C plus plus, this would be a really cool book to have. And then last but not least my favorite, my productivity planner. And if you are a real listener, you know that I love a productivity planner and I pretty much credit a productivity planner, all of my productivity. I'm not great with other words right now, but sounds great. It's amazing. The value of it doesn't really matter. I'm sure y'all can Google how much each thing costs, but neither here nor there. Oh, you'll also get a, Git Cute sticker.

Jocelyn (03:34):
My old Git Cute stickers. There are new stickers coming along the way. There's also pins and I'm designing. I'm thinking about doing like a limited t-shirt run just because I like t-shirts and I like design. And I figured I talked to a bunch of nerds that like t-shirts and pins and stickers. So of course you all would. Anyway, I digress here are the rules of what you need to do in order to be considered for giveaway. Number one, and you must follow. Get cute podcast on Twitter. Don't follow me on Instagram. I never need that. Instagram. It's practically just there for a placeholder for namesake. Number two, you must be subscribed. So that means you must be subscribed to me on Apple podcasts on Stitcher, on Spotify, wherever you can download the episodes three, you must leave a review and a comment on either Apple podcast, Stitcher or wherever else.

Jocelyn (04:32):
You listen to the Git Cute. That allows the ratings. The comment is really important. I'm not sure why, but I just know that five star reviews are great and dandy. I appreciate those, but also the comments along with it is what really helps me out. Yeah. So you don't have to say anything long or poetic. You could literally just say Jocelyn is making me write this or something like that. And yeah, it's true. Or if you do want to be truthful and just say great podcast, whatever, I'm not dictating your life, but just leaving the five star review and the comment that part I'm dictating, and then please feel free to tweet at, get cute podcasts with a screenshot of the rating. And please use the hashtag hashtag get cute, give away because it just is easier for me to keep track of everything. So I'm not clicking around and trying to figure everything.

Jocelyn (05:30):
Okay. I think I have covered everything. So to recap, I'm giving away an interview bundle. It includes cracking the coding interview, grokking algorithms, elements of programming interviews in C plus, plus that I productivity planner and get cute stickers, which you can put anywhere and what you really need to do. Follow subscribe, leave a five star review and comment, and then tweet at, get cute podcasts with the using the get cute giveaway. I figured this was the easiest way to do this for y'all. And I just wanted to say, thank you. So this is my way of saying thank you. Now I mentioned previously about some get cute merchandise. I really don't like saying merchandise because it seems so bougie, but it is what it is. So I am designing stickers currently and yes, I do design and draw all of my own stickers and Twitch Emotes and all that stuff, because I'm really cheap.

Jocelyn (06:29):
So you could think this is terrible, but I like it. So there are two new sticker designs coming, which should be up within the next two weeks. I'm a pin design one pin design because honestly I've never designed pins before. And I wanted this to be really cute and encompass what get cute and me is, and one pin and possibly a tee shirt feel free to tweet at me. If you actually liked the idea of having a tee shirt, like I said, it would be a, probably be a limited run just because well, I haven't started my job yet, so I can't be shelling out all these coins for t-shirts that aren't going to be, but you know, it's a thing. So perhaps there will be a Google survey coming out about that in the future. I think that's, I think that's it. I think we've covered everything we've covered about August.

Jocelyn (07:23):
It was being the best company to give away, cover the merchandise. So yeah, I think we're allowed to go into what this episode is actually going to be about today. And this episode is going to be about how I interview software engineers. So a little tidbit about me. I used to do a lot of mock software engineer interviews with my very dear and close friend. And we just used to tag team interviews. I'm at the coding boot camp that I used to go to. It was one of our ways of giving back. It was one of our visa volunteering because both myself and my friend realized that learning coding gay. Yeah. But the soft skills with interviewing and knowing how to translate what you've learned and to something that you can actually relay back and forth. And doesn't sound like you're just regurgitating information that you've read from a textbook is really, really important showing how, you know, that knowledge and context is also really important.

Jocelyn (08:22):
So I figured that I would relay that information on to y'all if you also wanted to giving mock interviews for people that are possibly job hunting right now, or if in your current role, you are in a position where you need to interview people to come onto your team. I figured I'd go ahead and give you those takeaways that I have now, as far as sources are concerned, once again, sources are me, myself and I, because this is drawing directly from my experience with how I give my interviews. And, you know, I also want to give a disclaimer that, you know, if you are with a company and you're in a position where you need to interview people, usually they give you protocols on how to interview people. So by all means, please don't go back to like your manager or your employer being like, well, Josie on get cute, said it this way. So we need to do it this way. No don't ever do that because they'd be like, who the fuck is that? But also please make sure that you follow protocol how, whatever it may be, but you know, this is, this is how I do things. I will say that it does follow the traditional method of software engineering, which means it's a lot of technical questions algorithms, and you know, some soft skills things, but I'll explain, I'll explain it

Speaker 3 (09:49):
Let's get into it.

Jocelyn (09:53):
Are you teaching yourself a new language or framework or maybe just being stuck inside? Has you bored at edX can help. Edx is a centralized platform that gives you access to over 2,500 plus online courses from 140 leading institutions, such as Harvard University, MIT, university of California, Berkeley and tech powerhouses like Microsoft and IBM, I have personally enrolled in the web programming was Python and JavaScript course from Harvard because it's always great to refresh your skills when you're not using them in your day to day. The best part is that there are other people taking the class with you, so you don't have to grind through the courses alone for Git Cute listeners at edX has given you a discount to use the service and you can choose to use the discount now or later. To take advantage of edX discount, go to edX that org forward slash cute again edx.org forward slash cute.

Jocelyn (10:49):
So I figured the best thing for me to do is to break down how my friend and I went through the interview process. And one thing of note that this is an interview process for junior to mid senior engineers. I will also say that when I was giving my software interview questions that I was purposely making my questions challenging because I am of the belief that if you can handle really tough obscure questions about things regarding Java as a language frameworks and things of that nature, that when it comes to the actual interview, they're usually less tedious unless you're experiencing a Fang level interview or a company that is similar to Fang in that way, then things are going to be pretty comparable. I will also say that a lot of the people that were going through the bootcamp were going into the FinTech sector.

Jocelyn (11:49):
So a lot of the interviews that I've experienced with FinTech companies that are in my area and other companies hiring engineers in my area is that it's definitely not as difficult than other interviews, but again, the small interviews we started giving around week six in a 12 week programming boot camp. And we just wanted to make sure that we had a good measurement of where students were in terms of knowledge and also what pieces of an interview they were able to focus on and brush up on technically for an actual interview. And I would like to say that we have a pretty good track record. I would say that a lot of the students are very appreciative of the interviews that we gave. I think I only had one student that had some critique about the interview process, but the last time I heard of her, she still didn't have a job. So,

Speaker 1 (12:56):
Okay.

Jocelyn (12:56):
Maybe that, maybe that wasn't on me, you know, you know, okay. So first the structure, their interview. So myself and my friend, we always pair

Speaker 1 (13:08):
Interviewed tag team

Jocelyn (13:10):
And tech team seems so aggressive, pear interviewed people. A lot of times I also like having other people coming to the interview as well. And this wasn't to intimidate the candidate or anything. It was because in a lot of interviewing scenarios, there's usually like a panel of some sort that you have to deal with. And it's a very short amount of time to get across to you are and answer these questions. So we would have anywhere from two to six people sitting in an interview with this one candidate, again, not to intimidate them, but to just get them used, to having a bunch of people in the room and also to get them used to that. Not everybody is going to be paying attention to you. I know it's really fucking rude when engineers are like on their computer, on their phone during your interview, but that's just the reality of it because these inter these engineers have realistically been pulled away from their teams and their jobs that they're working.

Jocelyn (14:07):
So it is fair to say that emergencies do happen. And oftentimes the people conducting these interviews are hiring managers, which could be tech leads or things of that nature. So it's very likely that they do have some things that can't wait until after the interview to talk about or to answer the question. So just keep that in mind that these people are working. And although I do agree, it is rude now that I'm a working software engineer, I completely understand why they can't give their full attention to you. So that just makes it really important for you as a candidate to always be on and to get your point across and answer the questions as distinctly and accurately as possible. Now, when I start the interview my friend always kind of started off with the soft skills. But in terms of soft skill questions, we always ask the person can't okay.

Jocelyn (15:02):
So can you tell us a little bit about you just to kind of get them to warm up because usually the candidates very nervous and we just want them to kind of get the jitters out and to talk about themselves and their experience. Now, when it comes to this part of the interview, I cannot tell you how many people have had issues with succinctly talking about themselves and as witnessed by my last episode, it's very hard for me to talk about myself. But one thing that I am good at is getting the point of who I am as a person and my journey into tech across, and probably 45 seconds to a minute, if that, and this is important because as I said before, you have usually a pretty short time frame with each interviewer. So you want to be able to get your points across and to each introduce yourself as much as possible.

Jocelyn (15:58):
And another point is is that these engineers are also going to be asking you about your technical skills, which is obviously important, but what is also extremely important is this engineer thinking that they could work with you on a team. And so you need to let your personality show through this part, and you also need to succinctly get your life story or your career story out there, which is it's hard, but this is something that you need to work on before the interview. Obviously, a lot of people always just focus on the technical skills and SIS, we, we know, we know you do things, we know you memorize algorithms. She wanted me to stay in, but now it's time to focus on yourself and kind of get this point across that you are hire-able of one thing that I would always tell my interviewee is, is that, you know what, just don't be fucking weird.

Jocelyn (16:57):
And you know, this is coming from somebody that's very, I'm a very weird fucking person, which, you know what, I know how to turn that on and off in an interview setting. So you can always be weird, turn that weird factor on after the job. And by weird, I'm not saying don't talk about like your interest or your hobbies or anything like that. Weird as in like body language in eye contact your general demeanor. That is what I mean by being weird. I'm not talking about your fandoms or anything like that. So don't, please don't email me. Don't tweet at me. That is not what I meant because I probably belong to your fandom. Let's be real, but it's a lot of people don't have that self awareness about how they come off in interviews. And so that's also a very large portion of my feedback when it comes to interviewees about their body.

Jocelyn (17:49):
If they're making eye contact with everybody in the room, because that is very important, even if the person isn't paying attention. What if that one moment they do look up to talk to you, but you're not even you're talking to everybody in the room, but them, so it can be alienating to that interviewer. And it may seem like we're babying the interviewers a lot, but those kind of, because we are, and these interviewers are also in the position to give you are yes or no. So you do kind of have to baby them in that sense. And I also think it's just very basic like human interaction, that if you're ever meeting somebody or talking to someone, you do need to meet them. They, I, this is coming with somebody that has had social anxiety in the past. I don't have it that much anymore.

Jocelyn (18:38):
I kind of my therapist and I, we kind of bucket it into just, you know, general anxiety, but that, that is extremely important. So once the candidate kind of goes into their elevator pitch about who they are, where they came from what they like about technology and all of that, typically we try to segue into going over things that are on the resume. This is going to be a, a soft buffer when we get into the more technical questions. And I think that it's also a good way to vet the person to see if they actually know that technologies that they're speaking about that are on the resume. It's very important that you don't put anything on your resume that you don't know. I've said this in my interview episode from season one, but I'll, I'll repeat it again, please don't do that because I love picking out technologies that I may not necessarily even know.

Jocelyn (19:39):
And especially with this boot camp, I knew what curriculum they were being taught and what stage they're at. So if you have something like graph QL on your resume, I'm going to be like, Ooh, graph QL. And then I will pick that out specifically and ask you questions about it, not to be a Dick. But it is to see if you actually know what you're talking about. I'll ask. So I see you have graph QL. What is graph QL? I've never heard of that before. Can you explain to me what that is? And you need to be able to answer those questions, and if you answer that question, maybe I'll push it. I'll push it. Another question for it. I'll keep digging until I find a spot that you're not comfortable with because you don't know the answer. And again, these are for mock interviews and this is just a test, your limit of the knowledge.

Jocelyn (20:27):
And this is also for me. It's a good thing to indicate on the feedback that if you're going to have this on there, that you do need to be able to speak to it at some length. I would say mid length, I'd, wouldn't say great length because honestly, who does, but it's really important that you do know the technologies and languages and things like that on your resume. But this isn't where we get into like really deep technical questions. Like I said, it's pretty much a warmup to get them a little loose, gets them to thinking in a technically sound way and to kind of get them prepped up for what I would call the technical gauntlet. So I think I'm not, I think I'm a little bit worse off my counterpart. We were very much good cop, bad cop with me being the bad cop.

Jocelyn (21:18):
I just pick up on people's attitudes and things very fast. So my counterpart, he was very calm and collected. You know, he kept his actual emotions and feelings about things inside until afterwards. Like, but for me, I, my emotions and everything right on my face, I really I'm not good at hiding it. I don't have to tell you, look, I'm not good at hiding it. So, Oh no. So with these things, what, what I would call the gauntlet is I start doing like back to back questions. And because this is a Java bootcamp, I started asking questions like, what's the JVM, what to garbage collector. Can you explain to me the stack and the heap? Can you explain to me what static is? Can you explain to me what a static block is? Can you explain to me what a try catch block is?

Jocelyn (22:14):
Can you explain to me a try finally, can you explain to finally key word to me, things of that nature? And I do this because yes, it's things that are easily Googleable. That's why when you get into like senior to principal engineering roles, they really don't focus on that. That much. They usually focus on like framework things like say for Java specifics, spring and spring boot. But when it's a entry level to mid level engineer, for my experience, these are the things that they kind of grow you on in interviews. And I want to make sure that at the very least that these candidates have a good understanding of what those things are, because when it comes to knowing Java things like knowing what the JVM is and what it's used for is base base level knowledge, like base level knowledge. We haven't even gotten into constructors and, and accessories and things like that, or even polymorphism, which

Speaker 1 (23:14):
Okay,

Jocelyn (23:15):
Huge thing. That's something I grow people on a lot because it's an object oriented programming language. So you definitely need to do tell me about polymorphism and you need to explain with me

Speaker 1 (23:28):
With an example.

Jocelyn (23:30):
So what I mean by that is it's very easy for anyone that knows Java or has read Java books to know when you're just regurgitating what you've read, you've remembered a definition. And this goes to what I was talking about earlier. You need to also be able to use that in context, slake. Okay. Polymorphism, but how is polymorphism used in Java? Can you explain it to me with an example? I won't ask you to explain it to me with an example I would kind of expect you to, and if there's sort of a lull or a pause there, then I will be like, well, can you give me an example of polymorphism and have you talk it out or if need be, you can write it out on the whiteboard. I'm not personally opposed to you doing those things. And so we're stepping through the gauntlet where we're going through there.

Jocelyn (24:21):
And then we also look back at the resume and that's when we'll start to dig a little deeper, even on some things that maybe we brushed over in the actual warm up of the interview and, you know, get deep in to see where the level of knowledge is. And by that point, you have a pretty good understanding of at least with like very technical language technical things, where level they are. And so after probably like 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes, then that's when we would go to the algorithm, white boarding part of the interview. And so there it's no, it's no surprise that I don't necessarily like algorithm based interviews, but the reality of it in our industry, it's rampant. And so many companies, Fang companies, including companies that are also trying to emulate fan companies use this method of attaining talent. So with this algorithm in the mock interview, we only do one.

Jocelyn (25:21):
Well I lied. We would sometimes do two depends on how fast a candidate would go through the first problem. And normally our problems are string and array based. Because those are usually the most common problems that are going to be seen. And so we would do something simple, like reverse a string. We would ask them first if they've, you know, seeing this problem before. That's really important though. So if you have seen a problem before that somebody is giving you, please be honest about the fact that you've been given this problem before, because then the interviewer can go to a different way of solving the problem or a different variation of the problem. So if a candidate says that they've had that question before and they've already solved it, then I would ask the person, well, do you know, recursion? And this is kind of a, it's a trick, it's a trap. You know, I am a little tricky. I'm a little trappy and it's like one of my favorite things ever. So

Speaker 1 (26:22):
This is,

Jocelyn (26:23):
It's usually a learning point because if you don't know recursion, please say no. And I say that because it's very easy to trip people up on this question and I don't want to sit there and watch you fumble your way through it. Of course I would help you. We would help you in that scenario to get your way through it and explain like, what's your base case for this problem. And so if somebody does say yes, they know recursion, then I would say, okay, then solve a, given a string of sailor moon. That's like my favorite sailor moon, could you please reverse the string recursively? And you know, some people actually do get through it. They're like, okay, I've read about this, but I don't think I've implemented it before, or maybe they do know it, or if they don't know, it just be very honest with your interviewer.

Jocelyn (27:14):
And so usually the person does really well on that. Then we'd go on to an array based question especially if there's time left. And so after we go through all of that and we assess the situation, usually it probably takes like, I want to say anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes for the algorithm part to happen, sometimes the interviews happen really fast because the candidates are typically ahead of where we thought they would be. And that's usually really good because that way, when we come back in like two weeks or so, we can have a wider array of questions to challenge them. And then we ask them if they have any questions for us regarding like where we are currently what we've studied things of that nature. And then when that part is over, so the actual mock interview is done, then we will go into the recap. So the entire time during this interview process, we will have been taking notes either on a note pad or computer or ha or however, and we will go through and go question by question and say where they need work on this and that and give them very specific answers as to where they went wrong, because it's not good enough just to say, Oh, this is really bad. You need to be, you need to have constructive criticism or else people don't respond to that at all.

Jocelyn (28:38):
Today's episode is also brought to you by grinding coffee co grinding coffee co is a black LGBTQ plus affiliated owned coffee business that is aimed at providing coffee to gamers and podcasts owners like me.

Now back to the show, hopefully it's information and gives you some guidelines for mock interviews for yourself. Mock, I knew for years for your friends, colleagues, anything of this sort, it's really good to figure out how interviews are going to be conducted for entry level to mid level.

Jocelyn (29:30):
Again, senior level engineering interviews are a lot different. As I have covered in previous episodes that they thing like two episodes back now, all of the episodes are blurring together, but yeah, I think that's the end of the episode. As always, if you like this episode, please feel free to like, and comment and leave a review on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening to this episode.
