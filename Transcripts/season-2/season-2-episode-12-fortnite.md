**Jocelyn:**
Hello everyone welcome back to get cute it is Jocelyn and yes, I am back. Sorry for not having a episode last week. But I turned 32 last week and in a truly Leo fashion I, you know, needed to focus on celebrating myself and treating myself and celebrating. And you know, it was great especially seeing how gosh, like eight months ago, I wasn't sure I was going to make it to my 32nd birthday. I definitely just want it to go all out and celebrate with friends. And it was really great. It was amazing. And I couldn't ask for better people or friends to surround myself with and support me. So shout out to my friends that do listen to my podcast because they do support me. So thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes and the gifts and just the general love and support is really great, and I enjoy it. So I can't believe this is happening. I am recording this on a very rainy and windy and stormy night on Sunday. So this is going to be a great backdrop for what I'm actually going to be getting into which is slightly off the beaten path of what I normally talk about. But this is really exciting for me. And I think you all will like it and I found it extremely interesting but I seem to be very devoted to one faction of this topic. So we'll see. I am going to be talking about Epic Games taking on Apple. So if you don't know me if you don't follow me on Twitter, which is at so and so's, I am now an avid fortnight player. I started playing fortnight when it originally launched, but after maybe two or three seasons, I got really bored with it. And I stopped playing and devoted most of my time to Overwatch. But once the pandemic hit, and once we were in quarantine My friends and I, we needed a game that we could all play that was cross platform because one of my best friends plays on PlayStation and the rest of us are PC players. And naturally, we chose fortnight and I ended up absolutely loving it. I've been putting in probably three to four hours on average a day since we started playing gosh in like March or May, maybe one of those m months and it's become a huge part of me and it's a game that I really really enjoy. So naturally To my surprise when I am playing fortnight and I see this adage that saying that now vbox and for people that need to understand vbucks vbucks is just another form of in game currency for microtransactions within games, and this is specific to fortnight, and it's an in game currency that you purchase with real money and you exchange that in game currency for items like skins, pickaxes, things, they're all cosmetic, they don't give you any advantage in the game, but just makes your character look pretty and who doesn't want the character to look cool or Pretty. And it said that, you know, V bucks are now going to be 30% off for the rest of forever. And I was very excited about the main 30% off because I'm very much the type of person that if I see a skin, and I like it, and I think it's cute, I will purchase vbox in order to buy that skin. So it's like, hey, that's going to help me with my budgeting. Why am I lying? I feel like I have a natural budget. But anyway, I was really excited for it. What I did not know at the time was the legal battle, the legal battle over technology that was going to ensue between apple and epic.
Let's get into it.

I do have a few sources that I actually use when researching this. The first resources me because a lot of this was firsthand involvement. As seen this all unfolds since I was actually playing fortnight at the time of this all happening. Also, I'm going to be referencing a verge article, named Apple is holding the Unreal Engine hostage epic says a new motion by Kim Lyons and Russell brandom. And this was published on August 23 2020. And then the third and final resource I am using is the economic times at India times calm. And this was for the definition of a monopoly. Because while I know what a monopoly is in business terms, I needed some help, kind of giving the context to y'all as listeners because I haven't been in an economics class in a very long time. And I was always on everything else is going to be my own opinion. I should probably say that I am not a lawyer. I am reading all of this litigation as a consumer as a software engineer. And this is from my perspective, I am in no way shape or form giving any legal advice because again, Hi, I'm not a lawyer, I just feel so this is really, really interesting. And it's probably the most interesting thing that has happened in terms of mobile development in a really really long time and putting the match to mine other fortnight player surprise, there is a film trailer that dropped in game. And fortnight along with that, as I mentioned previously announced that vbox we're going to be 30% off for Well, you know, forever, which is really great. And I was curious as to why this was happening, because there was a disconnect for me. I didn't get the little trailer that they had showed, until I saw the vbox announcement. And then I went through, and I was doing some things in the games UI, and then I realized there was a trailer that automatically played, and hilariously, there was a skin that they had made. Now this was all happened at the same time that fortnight decided to announce a 30% off announced that iOS users would be able to have the option to process their payment through traditional Apple channels, which would be at the original price of, let's say 999 for what is it 1000 v bucks or something of that nature and then or they could actually process it through Epic's payment processing system and get the 30% off price. Which was interesting. And it's interesting to me how Epic Games all package this. It showed me that they were planning this for at least a while. I would say that to have an animated short ready to have a rollout with 30% off across all platforms, including PC PlayStation, Xbox and mobile now understand that PC and console players have no option but to process their payments through the Epic Games engine already, so we weren't really affected by this. This was definitely going to be for mobile users, so iOS and Android players. And so my friends and I, we immediately started talking, we're like, What is going on? What is what is happening? Why do we have a skin with a very mean looking Apple guy with sunglasses and I I remember saying that Epic Games is finally taking Apple head on. And it's because I believe Epic Games has definitely accrued the money and the cash flow to be able to take them on and litigation and they were pretty much saying Bring it on. And of course they knew Apple was going To pull fortnight from their stores because that's in that's just a general rule of thumb when you are developing a application for iOS that you need to
abide by the rules, it's kind of like in the contract that you need to be able to allow Apple to take that 30% cut. Now, personally, I think 30% is fucking ridiculous. I think that I was talking to my friends about this yesterday and I put it in the same context of say, say that I am an actor or an actress and I have a manager. Now, I think that managers are usually cut between 10 to 15%, maybe 20% on the high end, and Apple is taking 30% of all incoming cash flow for the application. I think that's kind of fucking ridiculous. I think that's a really high. I think that's high because there's already so many barriers with having to publish to Apple's App Store. Because you do have to have a Mac device in order to publish to the App Store. And so I feel as though you're already investing thousands of dollars in order to have a machine in order to actually publish your application. So I think it was just a little, a little much from my point of view, especially I'm thinking of, like, indie developers, I really don't care about these corporations squabbling over millions of dollars when we don't have millions of dollars so many other people have millions of dollars. So let me make that stance very clear. I do not give a fuck about these corporations, crying about them, taking millions of dollars away and who deserves the millions of dollars That's just fucking ridiculous to me. I am reporting on this net reporting. I'm not not a reporter. I'm not that great. I don't have a journalism degree. I am talking about this because I just find it really fucking interesting. I feel it really fucking interesting that another company finally has the balls to take on Apple, because Apple is kind of at the apex of how do I put this lightly? I feel as though Apple is I couldn't think of anything good. That wasn't going to end up with me saying something that like an apple to like an egregious like villain so we're just gonna move long so I don't offend anybody.
and also part of their Their messaging their marketing messaging was the hashtag free fortnight. Which is ridiculous. But given the fact that a bunch of kids play fortnight it's kind of funny because obviously gets trending and it gets people's eyes and attention to it, which is kind of freaking smart. But as soon as Apple pulled fortnight from the App Store, Epic Games, Amelie slapped them with a lawsuit, so they had lawyers on deck, they knew that this was going to happen. And they proceeded to go through to litigation. And as the verge article suggests, Apple also hit back at them with litigation, simply implying that there is nothing new here. This was in the contract or in the terms when you signed up for developer access. And it is what it is. And so Apple also removed and revoked developer access for Epic Games. So that is why my Microsoft is getting into the mix now. So I don't want to think that Epic Games is playing some really high level shit. But for those of you that don't know, Epic Games is the developer of the Unreal Engine. And a lot of other companies and games use the Unreal Engine. Specifically, Microsoft uses Unreal Engine for its game force, the mobile version. And so this has forced Microsoft to get involved because they are now filing a motion in this whole tangle the snuff foo, saying that, at the very least Epic Games need it needs to keep the developer access because otherwise there if there are some sort of bugs or any hot fixes that needed to happen to the engine, Epic Games isn't going to be able to do that and therefore affecting Microsoft In fact, Forza and affecting their bottom line as well. So this is just really exciting and hilarious to me. I really truly wonder what this is going to mean for independent mobile developers, if anything is actually going to happen. It's interesting to me because Epic Games is taking the stance that Apple is effectively holding monopoly over how their games can be published. And I mentioned earlier definition for monopoly, not I got from the economic times that India calm, and the definition that they give is a market structure characterized by a single seller, selling a unique product in the market. And in monopoly market, the seller faces no competition as he's a sole seller of the goods with no close substitutes. So in terms of what's happening with Apple, it vaguely and loosely fits that definition, but then There are other things that you need to take into account where Apple holds the sole rights to iOS to Apple phones. So how is that a monopoly? When they're the only ones with the phones, they're the only ones with that operating system. So I'm not sure how that's going to hold up. Again, I'm not a lawyer. I really have no skin in this game. I'm just interested in seeing how this is all going to play out. And I'm sure that in future episodes, I'm going to update y'all on it. Because it's just I keep saying it's interesting, but it's just it is It's wild to me that people are, are now realizing like companies that like companies like Google and Apple have effectively set themselves up for long term monopolies. And now there are people that are getting into In the market that are realizing that they could have way more money than they do have and they're starting to attack the big dogs, so to speak. Now, the question would be how is fortnight circumventing this what really piss Apple off in this whole thing? So along with this whole rollout, Epic Games actually gave iOS users the option to either currently process through Apple's payment processing system, which would cost them the original amount of the vbucks. Or they could process to epics payment processing system, which was at the 30% discount. And I believe that's what really takes Apple off. And that's what caused them to take it down. So my question is, in the future,
what the heck is going to happen are people just not playing fortnight right now on mobile? For those of you that don't know mobile fortnight is like a huge thing. Found out most of this through my friends, Bobby and new rule. But people actually buy iPads and things and set up controllers on iPads in order to compete in mobile only games through fortnight because there are a lot of mobile only tournaments that you can play through. And fortnight tournaments do give you thousands upon thousands of dollars if you win them. So it's like it's it's pretty huge things just as huge as console tournaments and PC tournaments. So I'm really excited to see what happens I'm hoping that people will still be able to play for my general understanding of just how the App Store works, I believe if you already have fortnight downloaded on your iOS device, so phone, iPad, whatever, you'll still be able to play the game but there's just nobody else that can actually download the game from the iOS app store in order to install and play it. I really hope that they change this because there are a lot of younger kids that play fortnight and chances are they're playing on their phone, or they're playing on their tablet. And they deserve to be able to play too. And they're the ones that are caught up in this whole legal dispute in this corporation greed. And I just think it's ridiculous, like the kids play for a night. But on the other hand, corporations got a corporate capitalism is terrible, but I am really excited to see where this goes because I'm hoping maybe somebody might just take a take a little chunk out of apple. However, Apple has like a trillion dollars in liquid funds so they could fight this for forever. I could be dead in the ground and they they would still be fighting writing this
