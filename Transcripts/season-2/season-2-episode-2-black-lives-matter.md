This is not an episode about PC building nor is it about the other episode that I have a script right now for this is because things here in the United States are at an apex that cannot be ignored. In terms of police brutality against black Americans and as a black American, it is only right that I use my platform to educate last week, George Floyd was murdered by four police officers. And there still has not been adequate justice served for that murder. And because of that, there are protests going on across the country, which I am extremely happy and proud that, you know, black Americans are being supported about these issues. And there's just no way that I can go on this week. Acting like things were normal and two posts, another episode. So this is a declaration to my listeners to please get out and to donate to any city's bailout funds that you can find. I will leave links to a few that I know of in the show, description notes below

Black, America's tired, I've been tired. I've been very vocal about my experiences as a black female in tech as a software engineer. And you know, that just also extends to being a black woman in America. And if you listen to this podcast, if you subscribe, if you like listening to my content and you support me, then please support me. And the rest of my people by donating, be vocal about the atrocities that we have been seeing for decades against black Americans, please speak out. And if you are a non-black person and a friend, a relative, or anyone is being racist or out of line please speak up. Don't be afraid because it's okay to be uncomfortable when you're uncomfortable growth happens. And to put it, frankly, black Americans have always been uncomfortable. We've been uncomfortable in our own skin. Since we were born, we were taught by our black families to be uncomfortable in our own skins because that's, what's passed down from generation to generation.

Unlike other non-black people where generational wealth is passed down, we have been passed down anxiety and fear against the police. And it's not happenstance that's happened. It's not happenstance that decades later, that's still the case for black Americans. And so if you could just please know that support your black friends fight for us because things are at a fever pitch right now. And we're going to need the support now more than ever. So that's all I have to say. You'll get an episode next week at some time for that I will talk to y'all later. Hopefully. Bye.
