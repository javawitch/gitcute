Speaker 2 (00:36):
Hi, everyone. Welcome back to get cute. This episode is going to be really awkward mainly because I had the idea of going forward with an episode about big O notation and was really excited to get up and start going back through the cracking, the coding interview and taking notes and kind of putting it into a format that's easier to deal with and what is in cracking the coding interview. And then I realized it would be super awkward to not address the big fat elephant in the room. The big fat elephant in the room is my medium article. If I do have listeners that have no idea what the heck I'm talking about by all means the link to the medium article will be in the show notes. I need to address a few things first. A I never, in my wildest dreams thought that the article would take off in the way that it did.

Speaker 2 (01:47):
I know I had some followers on Twitter and I know that posting the article at the time on the tale of two other women of color that also worked at the same organization that I did would give it more exposure. And I thought that would be good because I'm glad that capital one is taking notice and it starting to understand the damage that they have done primarily to the room of color that work in the organization and a capacity as a software engineer. Now, did I think that it would go quote unquote viral within the tech Twitter community? No, no, I did not. I did not expect thousands of people to read what I wrote because what I wrote was really cathartic. It was something that I had been holding on to for a very long time. I've friends that are still within the organization, reach out to me and say that, you know, you should probably talk about your experience because the voice of a black woman within the organization was not heard.

Speaker 2 (03:14):
And I feel as though my experience and since posting it and sense having countless numbers of people. And let me just pause and say, thank you so much to the people that have DMD me that have emailed me that have added me on LinkedIn that have emailed me. I cannot thank you enough for your support. And I also cannot thank you enough for trusting me with your situations and experiences within capital one. And then also within other tech companies, aye, tweeted a few days ago that as much as I appreciate it, I'm still on my road to recovery. I am still fighting against the PTSD that is involved with just trying to get a job right now. And so I just do not have the spoons to also take on your trauma and also try to help you with yours. I'm so sorry.

Speaker 2 (04:23):
And I hope that some time in the future, I will be able to help you and to heal with you, but right now I solely have to focus on myself. And I apologize for that, but please do not think that I don't understand or take for granted the fact that you've reached out to me and you felt there was a connection there to do that. So thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Anyway, I digressed, so I really didn't know that this was going to take off in the way that it did. Am I glad that it took off in the way that it did, I guess, because primarily the response to it has been positive. And I will say that people offering support to me and validating me was the biggest thing, because I honestly even talking to friends some of my closest friends, I didn't feel like they truly understood what I was going through.

Speaker 2 (05:29):
And that's fine because everybody's doing and going through their own shit. So I'm not expecting my friends to like also have the emotional capacity. It also deal with my bullshit too. Let's be clear about that. I I'm not expecting that of them, but I do feel like they didn't truly understand. And it could be the way I was describing the situation or perhaps it's because I had been in this situation many times before at other companies the magnitude of what I was going through. And so people saying that this shit's really fucked up just reinforce that, Hey, this shit's really fucked up. And I really, I really, really appreciated that today's episode has been brought to you by audible.

Speaker 2 (07:41):
So what I want this episode to be is for me to further address my time at capital one, address some misconceptions that people are seeming to have about my time at capital one. And then also to give y'all some advice, because I don't want this just to be an episode about me, like Boohoo me and I mean, yeah, boo hoo me. But at the same time I started this podcast because I wanted people to think that I had technical knowledge and knowledge to give and share. And I'm still going to use my platform for that, even though this is a lot for me, it's, it's, it's a lot for me.

Speaker 2 (08:31):
So I think the first thing that I need to address is the timeline of the article itself. I began the article with a specific date and I ended it with a specific date. And between those time points, I detailed a lot of things that had happened to me regarding my manager regarding some senior management, et cetera, et cetera. Now I did not put in every single thing that had happened to me. I need people to understand that those were just the prominent things that I had in my head when I was writing this article, after it was done, I did do a Twitter thread after I tweeted out the article and did talk about more things that had happened to me that I was subjected to while I was with the organization, primarily with my manager at the time and the scrum master at the time, I also wanted to clarify that the scrum master that I have God prior to my short term disability was truly awful.

Speaker 2 (09:42):
And when I came back, we had a new scrum master who was a female. She was so nice and so caring. And she looked after me and she knew that I was having issues, obviously coming off a short term disability cause people don't disappear for almost two months for no reason. And she checked up on me and she asked how I was doing, and she treated me like she knew what was going on and also just wanted the best for me. And I cannot say enough great things about her. I know that she is no longer with the company now, which is sad because they needed somebody like her. And she was amazing. She was a great support system along with my product owner, who was also a great, great, amazing woman and such a great support system. And she saw everything that was happening and she was also dealing with the same type of bullshit on our team and with the company within our org.

Speaker 2 (10:46):
So I, I cannot thank those women enough for supporting me in my last few months because it was really hard. It was really difficult to do that. And so, yeah, I didn't talk about everything because a lot of it is still triggering for me. I just thinking about it and processing it, I choke up if you can't hear it's still very difficult for me to talk about, but the point of this is to say that these are things that should not happen to anyone regardless of race or gender identity or anything. It's not lost on me that a lot of people go through this in our industry, a whole hell of a lot of fucking people do. And it's bullshit. We shouldn't have to deal with managers that aren't fit to manage people. We shouldn't have to deal with that. Have an ego that need things done very way, or it's not the right way.

Speaker 2 (11:59):
We shouldn't have to deal with the fact that there are people in high places that know what is going on. And they do nothing because it would be bad for them politically within the company to save you. And I think that it's fucking bullshit. I think that companies need to be held more accountable. And maybe that's another reason why I wrote the medium article. Maybe that's why I'm glad that people inside of capital one are circulating the fuck out of my article because they now have a face to the story. It's not just anonymous. Not saying that the anonymous articles were any less important, but once they have a face to a story, they can't ignore it any longer. And I'm glad that I called them out. I'm glad that maybe they will realize and start changing, but at this time, do I suggest anybody work at that company?

Speaker 2 (12:59):
No, no, I don't. I don't suggest that anybody do that. I don't suggest anybody straight out of college. I don't suggest mid-level senior level of principal. I suggest nobody work there because is, it's absolutely toxic. I've seen firsthand just how hard it is for the rating system to go. It's absolutely fucking ridiculous. It's such a bureaucratic pile of shit. And I know that cap one, isn't the only one that has it like this. I know there are other companies like that. And I know that, you know, I just got put on a really shitty team and that not everybody's experience is like mine. Not everybody had to deal with that. I know that a lot of you can still just sit there within your privilege and not have to address it or say, well, you know, it's just because you didn't know enough or you are a junior developer.

Speaker 2 (13:56):
No bitch. I was a senior associate developer there. So actually I'm not junior. That's another thing that was odd. It's just weird to me that now, you know, since I'm so junior, I'm like interviewing for senior level positions, but that's besides the point I'm, it's just a clusterfuck and obviously y'all can tell, I didn't write a script for this episode. This is very much me going off the cuff and you know, kind of losing it right now. I highly suggest y'all, don't go there. I highly suggest that if you're dealing with something currently in your job that is making you feel this way, or that is making you feel like you're not enough and it's making you feel like maybe you don't belong, not just within the industry, but don't belong here on earth anymore. Like I did get the hell out.

Speaker 2 (15:05):
I'm so grateful that I had the moment of clarity to go to my general practitioner and get help. And I think of all the people that didn't have that moment of clarity and it would be really terrible of me to not point out that that was a huge part of why I'm still here. And I need to tell y'all to get out before you get to that point. Because it's, it's it's damaging it's, it's not something that you can quickly get over at all. So you, your worth as a person is so much more important than anything else in this world.

Speaker 2 (16:05):
And I'm sad that I let my ego and the money distract me from that. And I don't want that for y'all. It's not allowed. Please get out while you can, if that is going on for you, if you're having a great time at work, by all means, carry on, do what you need to do. But I just know that there's so many other black women out there that are struggling like me or women of color that are struggling like me. And I just want you to know that you can get another job. It's not that hard. It really isn't. You can find value elsewhere. And I think that's it. I think that's all I need to say about this stupid article that won't go away because now everybody knows. And it's not something I can just delete because it's out there.

Speaker 2 (17:18):
The internet never forgets. And I just have to deal with the consequences, what that all may be now. And yeah, I should tell y'all this episode is not going to be edited. So my ums are going to stay in there. The awkward pauses are going to stay in there. This is just about as raw as a podcast episode can get. So I think, I think that's the end of the episode. So thank you so much to everybody that has donated since the last episode, because last week I did not have an episode because it was a holiday weekend, even though I don't celebrate that holiday, but I needed to take a break for studying because I'm in the midst of studying for interviews that are happening.
