Nuru (00:00:36):
[inaudible]

Jocelyn (00:00:36):
And I am back with the PC building episode that was promised a couple of weeks ago. Um, if you actually listened to my black lives matter episode, I highly suggest you listen to that because it is very raw, very me feeling a certain type of way, me still feeling a certain type of way. And, uh, I decided to go ahead and move forward with this episode, because I felt as though, you know, as a black woman trying to support her small business, I just needed to go ahead and get to it. So this episode is going to be really exciting because I have guests to help me talk about PC building. And it's just going to be a very, uh, organic, honest conversation about PC building, along with the questions that y'all have given me or suggested to me via Twitter, which is really exciting.

Jocelyn (00:01:34):
And I hope you all liked this episode. Oh, almost forgot me. Disclaimer, disclaimer, my guest and I, we're going to cuss. We're going to be talking about technical stuff. If you, in any type of way, feel as though that that's going to take away from the quality of this podcast, the quality of the content, then I'm going to suggest you to stop. And since grad find another podcast, because this is not for you. Um, but if you are still wanting to know a shit ton about PC building and are really excited to hear me and two of my closest friends talk about PC building, then stick around because this one's going to be really good. Okay. So now if my guests can introduce themselves

Nuru (00:02:23):
Fair, uh, here, uh, this is Nuru, uh, I'm a software engineer primarily dealing with, uh, enterprise middleware. So Java and spring. Um, my favorite games through the years for, I guess, to stay on topic since we're talking about gaming PCs here, uh, been halo, a GTA San Andreus. I love fable back in the day, the original one, and now it's been for all the time, but you know, we're open to trying to get into like some of these other new Pango games that kids playing these days.

Bobby (00:03:04):
And I am Bobby, I'm also a software engineer focusing on middleware, mostly Java oriented code, much like new Ru I have been gaming for a while now used to be mainly console gamer until one day I decided to go with building a PC to see how that works out. I'm Mo mostly play first person shooters, things like that. But I expand out to things like ruins Cape, you know, keep my nostalgia going a little bit. We'll see what happens with the newer games. I'm real interested in some of the stuff coming out.

Jocelyn (00:03:33):
Okay. And I guess I gotta throw my fucking credentials out there. Hi, I'm Jocelyn. I'm the host obviously. Um, I'm also a software engineer currently unemployed loving it. Um, so as far as games I've been gaming since I was like nine. So the better part of two decades got I'm old. Um, and so I primarily play like first person shooters, but when I was younger, I was really into like RPGs, like final fantasy, seven, eight, 10 tend to, um, but right now my main game is Overwatch, but I have been suckered into playing way too much Fortnite during this pandemic by said people in this podcast episode near now. So

Bobby (00:04:20):
I've never met that man in my life.

Jocelyn (00:04:21):
No. Why am I like a level 284 or one 184 and Fortnite right now? It's it's wild we're professionals. We are professionals. Oh my God. Okay. So let's start out with the one thing that I feel like people get really worked up over as far as PC building is concerned and that's price. So I guess I'm going to ask you Nuru since the two of you both have differing opinions and I kind of side with Bobby on his opinion. Probably

Bobby (00:05:00):
Showing the bias right out the gate. I like it,

Nuru (00:05:03):
But yeah. So what is the question, I guess, what range do I feel?

Jocelyn (00:05:08):
What do you feel like is a comfortable budget for a PC? I mean, we've already kind of discussed that we're all gamers. So just as far as everybody's knowing that all of our PCs are geared toward games, that's it? Well, mine's games and streaming, but talk a little bit about that. Like, what is your budget? Like, what do you prefer?

Nuru (00:05:30):
Um, so for me, um, I guess in recent history, and obviously it hasn't always been the case, but my budget typically ranges between, uh, 1500 to two grand. Uh, and obviously with like a little bit of an exception on, on the upper end, if you know, it is something worthwhile, a big thing for me is I enjoy the convenience of like, not having to like actually assemble everything myself. Um, but you know, uh, so that that's, I guess my price range.

Jocelyn (00:06:09):
Alright, Bobby.

Bobby (00:06:13):
My price range. I don't even know if I can give myself a price range, cause like I fall on the side of, I like high end stuff. Like if it's not a mess, usually I want to buy something. That's going to be at least the best that I can possibly do. So I tend to fall towards the higher side, but it's always good to at least see what a budget one might look like. But nine times out of 10, you're going to see me on the more frivolous spending side, just cause I like having high end stuff. So like two grand budget, that's going to be mostly towards the baseline of what I'd be looking at.

Nuru (00:06:45):
Oh Lord.

Jocelyn (00:06:47):
And so, I mean, I guess, yeah. So I do agree with Bobby A. Little bit. Um, I mean our reasons for spending the money is different though. Um, Bob is very much like I need the best of what's out right now versus for me, I need it to be pink. And uh, that's what, that's what drove me to buy this case that I have. And it kind of, um, you know, spun out of control a little bit. So I bought the case, which is pretty expensive for a case. Anyway, my case was $200, which is unheard of really, um, especially for it to be a mini ITX case. And then I kind of just built around that and building around that and also, um, having it need to be, to meet the performance standards that I needed for games and streaming kind of like blew my budget out of control really. But yeah, I definitely agree with Bobby. It's usually like I don't have a limit on him as much. Like, so as long as I like it and it works well, we're good, but I guess I don't have a budget, I guess I kind of like baited you into that one new newer, I'm sorry.

Bobby (00:08:06):
There'd like, I got price range here. It's just like the limit.

Jocelyn (00:08:13):
But I do also want to say that the budget does not include peripherals. So that's excluding like mice. Like

Nuru (00:08:22):
I feel like that's almost always the case. Cause like, I mean for the average person, I feel like you do research on the peripherals and other stuff separately. You know what I mean? Like at least in my mind when I'm like getting the computer, like my like focus is getting the computer and then the only time you really start adding or removing peripherals is like, when you either have a problem with the ones you have or the ones that you've been using or, you know, like something kind of comes up, uh, from like aspect, at least that's, that's been my driving force, although I have bought, you know, the occasional, uh, keyboard, just because 60% are that.

Jocelyn (00:09:11):
But no, I just think that when people, especially for using like PC part picker, right. Um, they show the budgets on a lot of those builds and um, a lot of the things with a lot of what's wrong with that is that it focuses on the hardware. It didn't really focus as much out unless the person actually adds those things to the build itself, like the price of your keyboarding or mouse and your fucking monitor or if you have to it never into the full price. So a lot of the times when people start budgeting out for things, they're like, okay, well, my budget's 1500. I'm like, okay. Yeah, it's budgeted out for 1500 for all of your hardware, but what about you don't have a keyboard?

Bobby (00:09:53):
How do you plan on viewing this computer?

Jocelyn (00:09:55):
Like you don't have a monitor so that can easily, depending on, I don't know how you feel about keyboards and stuff that can add on like an extra $500.

Nuru (00:10:05):
That's part a different thing. Uh, cause like that's like first time, right? It's the people that tend to face that issue, right? Like if you're over here swapping from one thing to the other, like if you've already built, you kinda have like, you know what I mean, a few parts laying around that you can either continue to use or I guess sell, um, and like, you know, upgrade,

Bobby (00:10:29):
Not all first timers do like a budget bill though. Like there's a lot of first timers out there. Well, they'll go right out the gate, give me that RTX 20, 80, super. And it was like, okay, you may not need to do that, but I get why you're doing it.

Jocelyn (00:10:43):
He just dragged me like, yo that's exactly.

Bobby (00:10:46):
Well, no, he like you, at least like you had an idea of what you were getting. Some people where it's like, Oh, I've heard [inaudible] the best. Let me throw that in my bill.

Jocelyn (00:10:57):
Yeah. I got the 20 S because I was quite literally at the time, the only graphics card that was available for me to buy.

Nuru (00:11:07):
And that is, that's another thing, right. Is like timing. Cause there are times depending on, I guess, cryptocurrency, uh, uh,

Bobby (00:11:19):
These are some of the most volatile selling stuff out.

Nuru (00:11:22):
Yeah. Like there sometimes one option could be a cheaper option. And like at other times a year or in time, like you might want to go with other places to buy your stuff or do we have like a next question that you wanted to specifically ask us? We can go wherever I'm not going to be blind, I guess. Uh, so could we dive into a prebuilt, uh, related questions? Uh, cause I, I kind of have like some things I wanted to,

Bobby (00:12:07):
It's not like he hasn't been talking about it for a week now.

Nuru (00:12:11):
I guess my first question, this might be controversial is, are gaming laptops always a bad idea? Because I feel like, uh, it has been my, uh, personal experience that like, yes, obviously there are, uh, gaming laptops that are, are able to evolve with the times. But I feel like, uh, so far for me, gaming laptops that get outdated before are like lack the ability to, uh, replace parts before, uh, typical tower models. So opinions

Jocelyn (00:12:55):
Do you want it

Bobby (00:12:56):
Laptops? I'm not going to flat out say laptops are a bad idea, but some of your like holdups with it do make sense. You are restricted a little bit more in terms of what you can upgrade. Like not every GPU you buy that works on a tower. It's not really gonna work in a laptop. So you are restricted in what you can buy, but a laptop will get the job done. At least at least one minimum standard, depending on how much you want to be able to do like 10 80 P gaming these days, a laptop's gonna probably do just fine most scenarios as long as you buy the right laptop. But that always plays into buying things like prebuilt or laptops, making sure it actually fits the criteria you're working.

Nuru (00:13:36):
Gotcha. Gotcha. Uh, do you guys another question? Oh my goodness. I didn't say, I just want to say from the outset that I disagree with Josh

Jocelyn (00:13:50):
On my own podcast, you know, on my own podcast. Um, so no, I primarily, uh, agree with the points you brought up and what Bob said obviously. But I think that, um, nowadays there are a lot of laptops because I was helping my friend Kelly looking at laptops. And you know, when I'm looking at specs, I usually try to the main things I look at or like the GPU, how much Ram it has and like how much actual hard drive it has for storage. Um, and I feel like a lot of companies are getting better at selling really souped up laptops and mind you, they are expensive because they're cramming all of this technology that's hardware. Exactly. And I mean, I saw a laptop and I think it was from Dell. I want to say that had like 20, 80

Jocelyn (00:14:52):
In it. And I was like four white [inaudible] things that are like, kind of unheard of. And it had, I think, want to say two terabytes worth of hard drive space on it as well, which was to me insane. Right? Because I'm like, that's what I have in mind, but it was also like $3,500. Um, and, but there's also other things you have to keep in mind with a gaming laptop is that, um, because they're so much crammed into such a tight space that heating is going to be overheating is going to be the main concern that you have and rarely can you use it like a traditional laptop and actually have it on your lap. Like you usually have to buy some sort of cooling mat or water cooling, like outside water cooling unit for it to be able to use that. Um,

Nuru (00:15:40):
I mean it is a summer though. People might be able to use their gaming laptops to start up a barbecue. It might be an additional benefit.

Jocelyn (00:15:50):
So I think that people just need to keep that in mind. Uh, especially if I don't suggest it. If you're trying to, if you have a budget you want to stick to, because if you have a, if you limit yourself that way with a gaming laptop, you're gonna see that your laptop is going to get left behind

Nuru (00:16:09):
Are the primary scenarios where that is the way to go. Obviously I guess if you are constantly on the move is one option, but like apart from that, are there any other scenarios that stand out in your mind where like a laptop is the way to go?

Bobby (00:16:26):
I mean, maybe portability is definitely something, especially if you don't have like a, even if we're talking portability within where you live itself, if you don't have like a set, this is where my computer is going to be. A laptop might be the best case scenario. Yeah. And there are like built PC way to go about that, but a laptop does fit that scenario.

Nuru (00:16:49):
Gotcha. Gotcha. Um, another, uh, question that I had is do you guys in your mind have any, uh, companies that stand up? Well, not companies I guess, but like, uh, PCs specific PCs that stand out as blacklisted prebills in your mind.

Jocelyn (00:17:10):
Can we just say Dell slushie?

Nuru (00:17:16):
Uh, me personally, I've had bad experiences with MSI, for some reason, both of you guys have had MSIs that seem to have served you well, but my experience with MSI is not that good.

Jocelyn (00:17:28):
Yeah. You had the prebuilt, uh, desktop. Yeah. And we both had, what was it? GS 73 VRS. I can't believe I remember that, but yeah, those were the gaming laptops we had before we, uh, took it.

Bobby (00:17:43):
Yeah. At this point I have like a gut feeling where I wouldn't really look at prebills that are coming direct from a company like MSI or Dell. Like there are those websites where they kind of seem like weirdly third party, but usually they get the most, I want to say like feel for having a custom built PC while having the pre-build aspect built into it. Yeah.

Jocelyn (00:18:09):
Yeah. If you definitely want more customization as far as like, if it gets down to like motherboard and CPU and things like that, it's better to go through a third party ish website versus like MSI or something. Cause they may have like a contract with Intel. And so then you're limiting yourself that way. Not saying there's anything wrong with Intel. Oh God. Um, but yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Nuru (00:18:35):
Okay. Uh, so specifically, um, and I guess, uh, this might be like a good time to look at the prebuilt that I was potentially considering. Right. What are the parts from a part perspective? What are the things that you want to focus on, um, in terms of the most bang for your buck? And obviously there's going to be some overlap, um, between, uh, pre-build customization and like actual, full, um, custom you build it yourself customization. Um, so do we want to do that now or

Jocelyn (00:19:13):
Yeah, sure. We can do that. I can. Do you want to just go down the list of

Nuru (00:19:20):
Uh, yeah, sure. So, um, I guess to give anybody that's interested specifics, I'm looking at this thing called the digital storm Lumos,

Jocelyn (00:19:32):
And I will put the link to this specific one in the show notes of the podcast. So people can click and follow along if they want to

Nuru (00:19:41):
Just do a, I guess started off, uh, pretty cool looking, uh, PC, you know what I mean? At least, uh, the demo model. They have lots of RGB, lots of lights.

Jocelyn (00:19:53):
I mean, it's all black it's okay.

Nuru (00:19:57):
Forgot Johnston. I'm yellow. There's a lot of RGB in there, man. I'm pretty sure you could turn that RGB pink.

Bobby (00:20:07):
You gotta be careful image above may not represent your specs. So you gotta watch out with those. Yeah,

Jocelyn (00:20:12):
No, you know how I feel about that though? Because it really irritates me and I'm going to go on a little rant that no, these people that are designing these cases, right? Like it shouldn't be that hard for anyone that wants a pink case too.

Nuru (00:20:32):
Pink specific or just any color?

Bobby (00:20:36):
You know, Jocelyn's about to go on a pink crusade

Jocelyn (00:20:40):
Because either the shades of pink are terrible or you have people out here like customizing parts on a case, like painting

Jocelyn (00:20:48):
It themselves or whatever. And you know, when people bring up that there needs to be more pink options. The first thing people want to say is, well, you can make the RGB pink, no bitch. I want both. I should be able to have both things. I am using my coins to buy it. It just took me a very long time to find a case. And I'm glad that I went,

Nuru (00:21:13):
But bookmarking or adding time

Bobby (00:21:18):
You want black or white color schemes, you got the options for days outside of black and white color schemes. It starts getting a little sketchy.

Jocelyn (00:21:24):
And it's just annoying because I mean, I'm not, this is

Nuru (00:21:28):
Let's timestamp this section, uh, fuck pink RGB.

Jocelyn (00:21:32):
No, no, no. I still have right now my, my, my headset holders at pink are like literally all of it. So this is a sidebar. I didn't want to get too deep into this, but everything I have connected to my cube pewter right now, including my razor mat, my mouse, my fans, the under lights on my case and the lighting on my headset stand are all pink right now. So I like it. I love it.

Bobby (00:21:59):
They think some people see red, she saw pink and she just went on a tangent.

Nuru (00:22:05):
Yeah. You want me to do a whole, I guess nine. He probably needs to describe this. I was going to try to do a screen share, but it's probably better for our audio listeners if I just described this. So I'm on the page. Um, just a start out. It's the starting price for this is, uh, 1,439. Obviously. That's probably before taxes, shipping, et cetera. Um, and Delaware, we don't know what taxes are. Right. But yeah, I'd probably get the shift to Delaware. Um, so I guess a few things that I probably wouldn't change, um, uh, just by default, uh, the first options are external chassis settings. So I liked, um, Jocelyn is probably going to disagree with this, but I like the, uh, case model. Um, it's not for everybody. Uh, they have some finish and trim options that I really didn't, um, care to make changes,

Jocelyn (00:23:02):
To be fair. I do like the fact that it's all glass though. I do love glass.

Bobby (00:23:07):
That's what my tower has. I got glass panels around most of the sides, not all the time,

Jocelyn (00:23:12):
Because then that also gives you more customization for the, your, like your internals, like your hardware and T cause like now you can have RGB Ram. Okay. Sorry, we're getting ahead. But I'm just saying, it gives you a little bit more

Bobby (00:23:24):
Plays into the customizability. Yeah.

Nuru (00:23:26):
Which, I mean, I think options are probably gonna be like a primary deciding factor. And because, I mean, that's, that's why option, you have the most options when you build it yourself, which is why that appeals to some people. I mean, the prebuilt versus custom is almost always going to be options versus convenience, I think is what the big debate bowls out too. Um, so, uh, from a processing standpoint, the models that I'm looking at are the Intel models. So the options I have are, uh, I five, uh, uh, 10, 404.3, an [inaudible] a 100 700 K and an I nine one Oh 900 K uh, from a CPU perspective. Uh, and the default is the I five, obviously, uh, six cores, eight cores and tech, or, um, and, uh, I guess, what is your opinion between those three options or are all three options back?

Jocelyn (00:24:36):
Um, I'll let Bobby go. Cause I'm in AMD, rising girl right now.

Nuru (00:24:40):
I mean, we can look at that too. They both start from the same perspective. So I guess let's start with that,

Jocelyn (00:24:45):
The thing, but, you know, so I mean, it's just a, it's just a processor.

Bobby (00:24:50):
Yeah. Like I'll, I'll lead in by saying like, I I've seen it happen on the internet a lot where like, he's have like companies like Nvidia and Intel where they all are like the, I guess you'd call it mainstream main company that people buy from for most computer parts. When then you got AMD kind of sit in the back a little bit, but you don't want to sleep on anything. AMD has. They may not be as prevalent LL. They're starting to get more prevalent now in comparison to companies like Intel, but they do their job very well in comparison to buying like an Intel, like Intel is going to give you a few extra frames for your FPS for when you're gaming, but a few extra frames, isn't something you're going to live or die by. Whereas AMD, they shine when it comes to like actual processing power where like, if you're doing stuff like Photoshop or CAD things, that's when AMD shines usually better than Intel. If you're not doing something for gaming, but doing something for actual, like working processing on your computer itself.

Nuru (00:25:56):
Yeah. Okay. Um, so, um, looking, uh, I guess just to feed into that at the AMD options, the AMD version of the same, uh, PC. So they definitely have more options, uh, from the AMD side, uh, they've got like two, two, two, two, two, six score to eight cores, a 12 core and a 16 core. Uh, so I guess what at present would be your cutoff for an acceptable CPU, um, in like modern times and probably giving a little buffer to, uh, to future proof yourself a little bit so that, you know, by come next summer, you're not like, no, I need a new,

Speaker 6 (00:26:51):
I mean, like if at the Intels you're either going to want, they only sell [inaudible] on this digital storm site, but that's probably because if you're high five, I don't know if they have anything below five these days, but I five-year limit if you're going anything that's worse than an I five. You're doing yourself an injustice there. So high,

Nuru (00:27:10):
Lowest you would go, but what would you rate

Jocelyn (00:27:13):
I'd recommend [inaudible]

Speaker 6 (00:27:16):
Yeah, you can get a nine, nine. I mean, as long as it fits the budget and it works always CPU is one of those purchases where you want to make sure you have a solid CPU because that is the core of almost everything.

Nuru (00:27:28):
Yeah. Okay. Uh, so we've got the I nine selected, uh, it's a plus three 98. Um, they are recommending that. I upgrade my schooling. Uh, we'll get to that though. So motherboards, right? Uh, this company,

Jocelyn (00:27:45):
Oh, wait before we go onto other boards, but I will say that, um, I see that the one that it came with was the rise in seven 37 X 3,700 X. And that's the one that I have. And I would say that is the bare minimum for like an AMD processor that I would get, like, I am actually kicking myself that I didn't get a 3,900 X. So that's the processor. Yeah. That would be my recommendation. But like Bobby said, if you, if it's in your budget, um, I, whereas I didn't necessarily have a budget for my PC. I also like had to reel myself in and there's absolutely nothing wrong with a 3,700, by the way, it's eight core. So it's great. But I also had to like, you know, reel myself in as far as like, I'm not doing anything wild,

Speaker 6 (00:28:35):
But play a little impulse control. Yeah.

Jocelyn (00:28:38):
Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Motherboard

Nuru (00:28:42):
Default one they have here is the ASIS primes [inaudible] um, or I guess the MSI [inaudible] pro it looks like the two are interchangeable and you kind of get that. It looks like they swap back and forth, um, between, uh, ACEs at MSIs.

Jocelyn (00:29:06):
Okay. I'm assuming that it's all RGB related, right? Like they all have RGBA with ASIS in MSI they're gaming.

Nuru (00:29:14):
Can you fall one would not appear to,

Jocelyn (00:29:18):
Hmm.

Speaker 6 (00:29:21):
Do you want to talk on motherboard since I talked about CPU Joslin?

Jocelyn (00:29:24):
I mean, sure. We can talk about it. Um, but then I'm trying not to segue into RGB things because RGB is a delicate topic when it comes to PC building and I'm pro I'm pro RGB because I'm just pro

Jocelyn (00:29:42):
Aesthetics, you know? Um, so as far as what I look for in a motherboard, I feel like this may be a little controversial unless you are looking for a specific size motherboard. Like say if you have like a mini ITX build, like I do, um, that honestly all motherboards are pretty much the same. I set it. Um, unless, because they usually all have like the same chip set in them anyway, depending if you're doing Intel or AMD. So it really comes down to what you want to look for to another board, because I feel like people may just

Nuru (00:30:24):
Difference. I'm seeing here are late, like outset is, um, the number of, uh, PCI express slots, what I'm seeing. And then also some of them have built in wifi. Yeah.

Bobby (00:30:39):
That's one thing. Right. I have a different opinion or a slightly different opinion from Joslin is like, yeah, generally most motherboards they're going to get the job done in a very similar fashion, but you do have to watch out for, especially when it seems like on this site, they don't give you a whole lot of information about the specifics of the motherboard. So you'll have to end up going and searching it up yourself. And you do want to confirm what slots are available on that motherboard for things like that, because they may be slightly different from motherboard the mother.

Jocelyn (00:31:11):
Well, obviously, yeah, that like, as far as like, what outputs do you have on your motherboard? That's going to be different, but I mean, as far as like processing power or anything, it's going to be the same. You need to just focus on

Bobby (00:31:24):
That actually reminds me. Do you do have to watch out for your CPU, some motherboards only support specific CPS. A lot of times they do have adapters to better support a different CPU, but a lot of them do specifically support a single chip set of CPS.

Jocelyn (00:31:40):
But yeah, but I think specifically on this site, though, if you, depending on what your CPU you decide to pick, it does give you only options for AMD.

Bobby (00:31:50):
I would hope prebuilt lively. Do it gave you the correct mother. Yeah,

Jocelyn (00:31:53):
I would, I would hope, but as Bobby was saying, you do really need to look at like what options you do have on your board. Like if you're somebody that like has a, here's a situation that I ran into say that you have a Mac monitor and a Mac monitor only handles like mini Thunderbolt. Um, and, and if, if you have something or if Thunderbolt three is something that you need to have, then you need to make sure that the motherboard that you are buying supports Thunderbolt three and the Thunderbolt three, hasn't been like a mainstay. It's not a staple necessarily as much as Apple's trying to drive it toward that. Um, so not a lot of other support

Jocelyn (00:32:40):
That there's only a couple, I think from, um, AEs rock, what, um, who made my motherboard. They have like one motherboard that supports Thunderbolt three. So you need to keep those things in mind because you can't just plug that in with like an adapter and to say your GPU, because a lot of GPS don't support Thunderbolt three capabilities. So that's something you need to keep in mind. Um, also if you don't have like a USB hub or something, then you need to keep in mind, like how many ports you're going to be looking for? How many ports you want, if you want RGB, like some of them, some of them other boards don't have RGB spots for your fans. So if you get another motherboard that doesn't support RGB, then those RGB fans that you just bought are useless because they don't have any power to them. So that's things,

Nuru (00:33:34):
Some of these concerns are kind of why I, uh, tended towards, uh, prebuilt options. Cause like compatibility issues typically, unless you're trying to upgrade individual parts of yourself, uh, typically, or like on any good side, shouldn't be as much of an issue. Um, I mean, obviously, you know, if you do your research, you, you know, you should be good, but like, I, this is, that was one of the reasons why I tended towards previous,

Jocelyn (00:34:05):
But PC part picker. We're also

Nuru (00:34:08):
Nice to stare at you all

Bobby (00:34:12):
[inaudible]

Jocelyn (00:34:13):
Accountability ability checks. So if something doesn't check, they're like, Hey, this motherboard doesn't support this. You need to go check, like, they'll tell you as well. So, um, they do have that

Bobby (00:34:23):
Compatibility checks or you're a power supply. So you don't actually.

Jocelyn (00:34:27):
Yeah. So yeah.

Nuru (00:34:29):
Does it cover the, uh, fan question that you mentioned specifically?

Jocelyn (00:34:36):
Like it'll yeah. So if you start buying a bunch of RGB stuff like outside of like Ram, which doesn't need them, it doesn't need like a port on it then. Yeah.

Bobby (00:34:46):
So that was one thing. Whereas there are some small compatibilities you may not see, like I had an issue of mine where the fans that I bought for the case, technically they fit, but with where the headers were on my motherboard, they're kind of getting a little smushed with how close they are to where the fans are actually being placed.

Jocelyn (00:35:06):
Yeah. I was granted, yeah. I ran into that issue as well with my motherboard, because it's a, I say this a lot in mini ITX sports, so it's smaller. And so there's even less room for like RGB headers. And, uh, there was a lot of, lot of chaining, a lot of Daisy chaining, a lot of Daisy chaining in this case for it to work

Nuru (00:35:31):
Handling of models, you don't have any dangling wires. I mean, I guess, uh, that, uh, your first point takes it to the next section on the page, which is the, uh, Rab. Um, and the question is to RGB or not to RJ,

Bobby (00:35:51):
I'm always an RGB person.

Nuru (00:35:54):
Um, so the options here are 16 gig, uh, do 32 64, et cetera, or what would be, um, obviously goes all the way up to something called the one 28 gig dominator platinum, which adds an additional 1300 odd to the price we're not going to get into.

Bobby (00:36:22):
Of course there are heavy duty Rams.

Jocelyn (00:36:26):
We use it like a BDSM bedroom, how weird marketing is so awkward

Bobby (00:36:33):
For, for Ram though, it's kind of hard to buy bad Ram, not to say bad Ram choice don't exist out there. They do. But a majority of Ram purchases that you will see at first will be more than enough. And also you want to focus more on how much Ram you get in terms of like 16 gigs of Ram, or is it 32 gigs of Ram, the feet of the Ram, what you see after the fact, but just like the 3030 200, they're not as important. The amount of boost you'll get out of like an updated speed is minimal at best compared to saying, if you got 32 gigs compared to 16 gigs of Ram. So the more Ram you can get the better, although at a certain point you can have too much Ram, not that it's gonna negatively affect how your computer runs. It's just, you're spending money. That's not being,

Jocelyn (00:37:24):
That's a waste of money. Yeah. So initially I had, um, 16 gigs around and, um, so, you know, obviously I have the podcast and then I also stream on Twitch and also play games. And a lot of those things are happening concurrently. And I was noticing that I was eating up Ram like immediately. And so I'm decided, I was like, okay, I need to upgrade to 32 gigs of Ram. There was no other way for me to do it. And so it's better to go low on the Ram and figure out, Oh shit, I need, I need more versus then getting like 64 gigs. And then you're sitting there with like unused Ram. Um, as my friend bumpers said, like unused Ram is just useless. Like you want to use all of your Ram. You don't want it to get to say like a hundred percent, which is where I was heading. But, um, yeah, you absolutely.

Bobby (00:38:18):
And a 10% you obviously bought too much, right?

Jocelyn (00:38:20):
Yeah. Oh, and also something really important that my friend bumpers told me because I just upgraded my Ram yesterday. I forgot to go into the bios and reconfigure the speed because it says 3,200 on mine. But, um, in the bio state configured it automatically to 2133 and I was like, wait a minute. That's not even so that I don't automatically do that. So you do have to go into the bios after you install your Ram and make sure that you manually set it to the speed that it is, uh, says on the card that,

Bobby (00:38:55):
Yeah, that's common across the board. Well, that's not like a specific scenario, usually they're going to default to the lower speed.

Jocelyn (00:39:01):
Yeah. So just to make sure in the bios, don't be me, make sure you go in and make sure that everything is set to what you paid for, obviously.

Bobby (00:39:10):
Yeah. Yeah. You're not going to see a monumental difference, but it does help. It,

Jocelyn (00:39:14):
It does help. Yeah. Yeah. You want to use what you pay for?

Nuru (00:39:18):
Alright. We are at 32 gig, uh, Oh, for the choice. Um, next up we have power supplies is a 600 watt. Uh, this is one specifically from, uh, the company digital storm. Uh, the other options are, uh, 850 while Corsair, uh, a thousand watt, uh, digital storm, 1200 Watts. And these kind of go all the way up to 1600 Watts. So, uh,

Bobby (00:39:52):
Unless you're like building like a super computer or like I'm talking like two high end graphics, processors and things like that, usually like that eight 50 watt power supply, that's going to get the job done because you don't need to be buying like the 1200 watt one, unless you got like heavy duty hardware that needs a ton of power.

Nuru (00:40:16):
Alright, so we're going with eight 50. Uh,

Bobby (00:40:21):
So what your GPU is going to be, your GPA is going to play the biggest part into what power supply.

Nuru (00:40:27):
Well, it looks like doesn't support, uh, it's supports up to an RTX 20, 70. Um, so probably gonna, uh, uh, for the eight 50 for this.

Bobby (00:40:39):
Yeah. Having enough power supply is always a good idea. You never want to go under the amount.

Jocelyn (00:40:44):
Yeah. And so, um, yeah, so I had a couple of friends and Bobby included that were really concerned for me because I bought a case. I came with a PSU, which is a power supply unit for people that don't know and built in. And they were not happy to say the least that I wasn't buying this stuff.

Bobby (00:41:13):
The reviews were a little sketchy. They weren't all bad, but there was enough bad. Or I even, I was like

Jocelyn (00:41:20):
Bobby, he was, he was tame on it. He was just like, I just, I just think you consider it. Whereas my one friend Siva was like, what the fuck you're using? What the fuck your is going to up then? So there was a lot of anxiety about that. However, what did come with mine, uh, was fine for the GPU that I purchased. And it's also, uh, an 80 plus gold, uh, GP, uh, PSU. So it is doing quite well. Has not blown up. Just throwing that out there.

Nuru (00:41:53):
I have not sent trap, no intern,

Bobby (00:41:56):
No. I mean, best case scenario, your computer just doesn't turn on. You get a new power supply

Jocelyn (00:42:01):
As long as nothing inside that bitch. Shit.

Bobby (00:42:04):
Yeah. The only problem with that is let's say you get a bad power supply that doesn't work for your needs. You could spend two days trying to debug a situation that could you think it's something that's not the power supply. Like why isn't it turning on? Yeah.

Jocelyn (00:42:18):
This, as long as he doesn't short and fuck up your mother board, because the, then that's not fun. That's not fun at all. Everything's fucked up. Then you gotta re you gotta buy everything again, but we're not gonna put that energy out there. You know what I'm saying? So let's continue.

Nuru (00:42:35):
All right. So, uh, I mean, unless you guys have any issues, the default storage from a hard drive perspective is a 500 gig SSD, um, and a two terabyte, uh, heart, regular, uh, heart disk drive.

Jocelyn (00:42:54):
So they don't have the 500 SSD, M two in Samsung. It's only in

Nuru (00:43:00):
Options if we did want to dive into that. So the one that they default to is obviously their digital storm SSD. Yeah. They have eight 16.

Jocelyn (00:43:14):
I don't see a Samsung M two and 500 gigs though. It's only in terabyte, right?

Bobby (00:43:21):
500 gig, nine 70 Evo. Plus

Jocelyn (00:43:25):
I do not see what y'all are seeing him

Bobby (00:43:28):
When the AMV bill, cause they may change up a lot of what you saying.

Nuru (00:43:35):
See, I don't see the options

Bobby (00:43:37):
I'm in the [inaudible] game. I'm in the Intel belt. That's why, that's where I'm at.

Nuru (00:43:45):
Cause I do the smallest one I see here is the one terabyte.

Jocelyn (00:43:51):
I'm just like a Samsung Stan. So if you, so if you do, I mean, honestly it doesn't matter.

Bobby (00:44:00):
Samsung usually just has a very good like support and well renowned for getting like your hard drive set up and things like that.

Nuru (00:44:10):
Alright so well with the,

Bobby (00:44:14):
As for the size itself, but default where you said it was 500 gig SST. Yeah. That's what I went with. That makes sense. You can store your O on there, any programs you install and you could use that as like the, the main operating system area for any like the programs that your windows or,

Jocelyn (00:44:33):
And then your other storage will be for games or whatnot. But yeah, I typically try to limit how many programs you put on that. So, cause obviously you don't want to run out of memory on that one as well. But, uh, I do basic stuff. Like I think I have discord on there and obviously my operating system, um, just like small things, but the majority of it would be on the second storage set, which we can go into now. Sorry.

Nuru (00:45:03):
Well, so for that, they really don't have lower options than the two terabyte options.

Bobby (00:45:12):
Okay. One to one to two terabytes of salad.

Jocelyn (00:45:14):
Yeah. I feel like I'm very bougie in that respect that like you need at least a terabyte.

Nuru (00:45:20):
Yeah. A memory definitely does go by quickly. Um,

Bobby (00:45:25):
It's a common scheme these days is to have that one SSD that's going to be your OSHC drive. So you have the speed boost of SSD on your windows system. And then in the like lowest budget scenario, you'd have your second hard drive, which is like a normal, like hard drive, like ex HDD. So it's not going to be the tiniest fast, hard drive, but you can get a lot more space for a lot less money. And that's where you or my guardian stuff

Jocelyn (00:45:54):
Seagate is the one I have the two terabyte Seagate and that's a hybrid drive. Um, and that's been pretty well for me as far as like booting up games and stuff. It doesn't take really a long time and I like it would I upgrade to like an SSD storage maybe, um, if it was, if it was in the cards as for, as far as funds, I probably would. I'd probably upgrade to an SSD secondary storage, but yeah,

Bobby (00:46:23):
It's like, cause I plan on using VR on mine, I have three hard drives. So I got the 500 gig SSD where all dos and stuff buys. I have a two terabyte HDD where any like general games where I'm not too worried about their performance on them when they're on top, on their, on there. And then I also ended up getting a one terabyte SSD that way I can put like VR related games, that way I know they're not running slow or things like that.

Nuru (00:46:52):
Alright. So I guess the next section, um, and, uh, from talking to you guys earlier, uh, this was potentially an area of question is the, uh, network access. So obviously the default is just the, um, if you default the motherboard, um, and default the, uh, network access, uh, I guess presets, it's just the builtin, um, ports, high speed network ports on the motherboard. Um, the other options involve, uh, a 10 gigabit ethernet connection, uh, as well as various other assorted, uh, wireless options you guys said, uh, typically you'd like to have that as a backup.

Jocelyn (00:47:44):
Yeah. Um, that was, that was me. I said, I like it as a backup mainly because you never know what can happen. Um, and I just like having that security of, of having, um, a wireless backup in case like, I don't know, like Luna like rips out my cord and I can't use like the quarter or something anymore, you know? Um, but then also I also liked the fact that, um, there's, you know, obviously motherboards that already have that capability built into them. Obviously you can always buy like a wireless card and install it yourself, but, um, I'm lazy. And I just like things being like, I would like it together as like a package, like, so I know that if my motherboard already has like wireless built into it, then all you have to do is like install that thing where it's like, when you're getting into installing like a wireless card, then that's one more thing you have to set up on the motherboard and then also make sure that your case housing has enough room for it, et cetera, et cetera. So that's how I feel about that one. I don't know Bob feels any other way, but I feel like you're as like,

Bobby (00:48:56):
If it's included on the motherboard that's best case scenario for me, I mean the less you have to buy the better. Yeah.

Nuru (00:49:05):
Alright. Um, so now we jump into the, I guess probably probably another, uh, primary spend area, which is the graphic scar. Um, so from, I guess, uh, talking to you guys, you're steering clear of the GTX is

Bobby (00:49:27):
What level, I guess, levels of weird, like elitist way to say it, but like what level of gaming are you looking to do? Are you looking at 10 ADP gaming, 1440 gaming, like that? That's the big question for your job

Jocelyn (00:49:40):
And that's going to lead into your peripherals. Like this is all connected people. It's all fucking connected. Okay. I promise you it's, it's a headache, but yes. Like what, what do you want as far as like an output visually?

Nuru (00:49:56):
Uh, I mean obviously best case scenario and based on what my current monitor can handle, um, I'm supposed to, uh, be able to do some 1440, uh, shit on this current monitor with a pretty high refresh rate. So I guess

Jocelyn (00:50:19):
When you're saying high, like you're talking like over one time,

Bobby (00:50:22):
One 44 Hertz monitor.

Jocelyn (00:50:25):
Okay. So then I would

Bobby (00:50:28):
Definitely RTX would be what you'd be looking at.

Jocelyn (00:50:30):
Yeah. Like, absolutely. And Bob, could you just explain to people that who may not know the terminology between like RTX and GTX exactly what that means? Because

Bobby (00:50:46):
So with, uh, this is specific to one video when people are mentioning like GTX and RTX, that's like their naming scheme for their generation of GPS that they put out. So you have things like the GTX 10 80, the GTX 10 60, and then Nvidia started working on something called Ray tracing, which is supposed to add a more like realistic lighting of sorts to games you play. And when that came along, they introduced the line of graphics cards called the RTX units. So then you got like the RTX 20, 60 VRTX 2080. So that's what the difference between RTX and GTX is DTX came first and then they were updated into RTX.

Jocelyn (00:51:33):
And then we're getting series three sometime this year. I'm pretty sure. So if not this year, like beginning of next year, I believe so

Bobby (00:51:41):
A mess. The frustrating part about the graphics economy is there's always something new, like constantly,

Jocelyn (00:51:47):
But the good thing is, is typically if you buy toward the higher end of whatever generation you're typically going to be, all right, no matter what they're going to be putting into the next generation, as far as, as far as support, um, for gaming.

Bobby (00:52:04):
Yeah. Usually you got at least a good two years or so maybe probably three.

Jocelyn (00:52:09):
Yeah. Your graphics card is definitely not something you have to upgrade as soon as like the new series. Like there's no use of having like a 20, 80 TEI and being like, Oh shit, serious three came out. I need to button. No, don't do that. That's ridiculous. That's just,

Bobby (00:52:22):
Especially if you're keeping into like tiny DP gaming, you don't need to bust your bank open every, every time something comes up,

Jocelyn (00:52:29):
That's something that you can absolutely upgrade. Like Bob said two or three years down the line. If like, I obviously you start upgrading when you starting to like install new games and you're realizing that your performance is diminishing, like all of a sudden, instead of paying on ultra settings, you're all of a sudden like medium or something. That's when you obviously want to upgrade.

Bobby (00:52:51):
Yeah. Don't, don't be reckless. Like I tend to be where like, you're go, something's new out by it.

Jocelyn (00:52:57):
Maya don't don't do the Bobby does. I swear to God, I do not buy a series three, but Oh my God, please don't do that. When they come out, don't do that.

Bobby (00:53:07):
I mean, this is the first I've heard of this tier three. I haven't kept up with the news. You sent me on this path. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

Jocelyn (00:53:16):
But uh, just to bring it back to which, uh, graphics cards you're getting. So I bought a 20, 80 super eight gigabyte. Um, G-Force RTX and I think it's great. I think Bob has a 2080, right?

Bobby (00:53:35):
Yeah. Uh, the, the regular, regular old 20, 80, I don't got the super and don't got the rally Stripe on my GPU.

Jocelyn (00:53:42):
Okay. So excuse me. That was the only one available. Okay. Blame these people during the pandemic that were like, I need to buy a PC and build it. I'm lucky I got it at the lowest price though. Of the year. So,

Bobby (00:53:58):
Or they said, I want this GPU so I can try and mind some cryptocurrency, even though that's not as profitable as it used to be.

Jocelyn (00:54:05):
No, it's definitely not. It's not worth it. Like your electric bill is going to be like in the hundreds. Come on now.

Bobby (00:54:10):
That's why I gotta be like those hooligans out there that a plant Bitcoin miners on websites and stuff and put all the work out on other people. Yeah. They were doing that. OnStar. Don't do that though. I do not support them.

Jocelyn (00:54:22):
Yeah. They were doing that on Starbucks wifi, but they, uh, yeah, but they, uh, you know, fix that. So don't be trying to mind through Starbucks, wifi. Okay. But, um, I mean, I think at the minimum you could even get a 20, 60 and still be fine.

Bobby (00:54:39):
Yeah. 2060 will definitely. It's at least future-proof enough to the point where you won't be like, why is my computer? It's almost. Oh, okay.

Jocelyn (00:54:47):
Yeah. And Bob keeps bringing up future-proof because I believe that we're both on the same wave length as we'll shell out the extra money for something that is going to be a bit more, I don't want to say high end, because that seems so elitist as well.

Bobby (00:55:02):
It has longevity to it.

Jocelyn (00:55:04):
Exactly. So that way we're not spending another four to $500, like every two years, you know? So yeah.

Bobby (00:55:11):
Like we said, a GPU could last two to three years, but that's like minimum scenario. That's when you might have to update, it could last four years or more depending on how the games.

Jocelyn (00:55:22):
Exactly. Exactly. I feel like you would have to, the way it works, the way, um, gaming developers are nowadays and not caring about what amount of space they have

Bobby (00:55:33):
Optimization is horrid.

Jocelyn (00:55:35):
What is optimization? Why are all my downloads like 84 fucking gigs? Can we talk about that? You would have to add more storage before you would buy a new GPU.

Bobby (00:55:46):
The stories about the call of duty updates is hilarious. Anytime I read it, they're like, Oh, new patches out time to download 40 gigs.

Jocelyn (00:55:55):
It's just wild. Absolutely wild. And yes, we know game developers. It's not your fault. You probably have shitty deadlines.

Bobby (00:56:05):
Yeah. They got one of the worst industries in the world and turn them to the bone

Jocelyn (00:56:11):
Businesses. Don't care about optimization. They're just like we needed this out at this day, like now, so we get it. We understand I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming the gaming business for not caring about because like what the fuck? What the fuck?

Speaker 6 (00:56:26):
Yeah. If you want, if you want to read about the bad practices of gaining business, just read the story about Anthem. That's all you need to read.

Jocelyn (00:56:33):
Oh my gosh. Yeah. It could have been, it could have been amazing, but then,

Nuru (00:56:40):
Alright, so, um, I guess the next section that we're about to touch on, um, after the memory point is, uh, the cooling. Um, this is obviously another big area concern. Um, for me though, specifically with this model, I wanted to go with one of the hydro Luxe, uh, cooling options that they had. Um, cause I want those cool, uh, tubes that you see in like the demo, uh, shown above. Um, so I am going to pick one of the hydro Lux options, um, as well as the hard line tubes. Um, and I'm probably gonna go with a red colored cooling liquid

Speaker 6 (00:57:33):
Must be the custom cooling system or their integrated cooling system.

Nuru (00:57:37):
Um, this is the one that I'm looking at is the hydro Lux, the first level of the hydraulics, uh, lights. So the integrated cooling system CPU, um, let me see,

Speaker 6 (00:57:50):
We won the light. I think the hard tube probably won't be

Nuru (00:57:55):
Won't fit to the pro. It looks like

Speaker 6 (00:57:59):
Because they're like, uh, I've, I've mentioned it before, at least off podcasts, not on podcasts, but like when you see that it says like custom cooling system, that's usually when you'd get those like hard tubes that aren't like directly connected to your radiator, to the CPU itself. Because when you have an integrated cooling system, it's all managed within itself. You just it's like a plug and play CPU cooler with the cooling aspect builtin. But when it comes to custom cooling systems and you have those hard tubes and everything built in, you're pretty much managing it on your own where you have to make sure the fluid in the cooler is taken care of like your dad, like a little reservoir, usually where it gets put into there. And there are, I guess there's some minimal risk involved where you got to make sure there's no leaks and any of the pipes that you connect and making sure it stays with them, the container that you've set up. So they'll come into play.

Jocelyn (00:58:56):
That's the biggest issue with water cooling in general. It's just making sure that that shit doesn't leak on to anything within your, within your case. Because once that happens, I mean, it's

Nuru (00:59:06):
Fluids are not supposed to

Jocelyn (00:59:08):
City do not mix. I mean they mixed, but yeah,

Speaker 6 (00:59:12):
You'd probably have a lot of your time since it's a prebuilt, at least initially you'd have an easier time since they'd most likely put it all together for you, but then it would be on maintenance comes along.

Bobby (00:59:22):
Yeah.

Jocelyn (00:59:23):
Yeah. Maintenance would be it. Yeah.

Bobby (00:59:25):
You'd have to rely on whatever warranty they have.

Nuru (00:59:28):
Yeah. So I guess that's a thing I need to, uh, make sure is airtight.

Bobby (00:59:35):
And that's another thing you'd have to check. I don't know how digital storm is running this, but let's say they have a warranty in place where somewhere down the line, you wanted to replace the Ram on your prebuilt PC and you replaced the Ram simple process and then you go, Oh shit, my CPU coolers messing up. I have to talk to support about this. And they go, Oh, you replaced the Ram. Your warranty is void. You're shit out of luck. So that's something you'd have to watch out for the prebuilt PCs. Yeah.

Nuru (01:00:04):
Um, so according to this, uh, scroll down to, and I probably need to dig into the money details of this, but, uh, from an upgrade standpoint, uh, the labor, uh, appears to be free. I guess there's probably going to be some concerns about actually shipping it back to them. Um, for upgrades, for par upgrades, you can ship it back to them, have parts, um, upgraded by them to keep it under their warranty. It looks like the default, um, three year later. Yeah. True. True.

Jocelyn (01:00:40):
So I just want to like make sure people that are listening understands. So when we're talking about cooling, we're talking about cooling for the CPU and the cooling is very important because you don't want the CPU to overheat because once the CPU you overheats then break your computer, it's fried. So that is what we're talking about. When we're talking about cooling, there's two options between cooling. Um, what Niro is talking about is he's talking about extreme cooling. So that's going to be liquid cooling versus just having say a fan sitting on top of the CPU to cool it, which is what I currently have.

Bobby (01:01:14):
And in terms of liquid versus fan cooling, like liquids, not always going to be like, Oh, I got, I get the liquid cooling, a fan cooling can do a fabulous job and keeping your CPU cool without having to get into liquid cooling. But liquid cooling does have usually a, um, sometimes a more significant benefit depending on what type of fan who are you using?

Nuru (01:01:34):
I mean, also, uh, for me specifically, the main reason was it looks cool, which

Bobby (01:01:42):
I agree with [inaudible]

Jocelyn (01:01:47):
Aesthetics. Hello, aesthetics, duh.

Bobby (01:01:50):
Like you got that glass plane, that class pain. You want to make sure people see what kind of stuff you got going on in there.

Jocelyn (01:01:57):
I'm, I'm actually looking at the fan on my CPU right now. And it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb because it's like Brown and everything else in my case, it's like black, but also, yeah, but it's also amazing the super quiet and my PC doesn't get over 58.

Bobby (01:02:14):
You also got for extended a low profile.

Jocelyn (01:02:17):
Yeah. And I did have I got into a low profile fan because I have a mini ITX case, but

Nuru (01:02:23):
So, I mean, I guess we've kind of made it through, uh, all of the, uh, core, uh, all of the, the core, uh, changes that we would, uh, make. And I just want to say congratulations team, uh, this PC that we've built, uh, appears to be, uh, close to $1,400 over stated,

Bobby (01:02:52):
Uh, our chassis spans included in that price. I mean, it's not going to significantly increase it,

Nuru (01:02:59):
The RGB, uh, which one did I add? Um, so the two options are the course here, um, or the thermal a thermal take. Uh, I think I will with the course there. Um, and that is, uh, the is 33 98. Um, also another thing I'd probably add too is to increase the warranty. Um, if it is actually an effective warranty, um, just to have the option, um, to be covered since it's a prebuilt and, um, the primary concern is like not having to void your warranty by doing other stuff. I feel like I would opt for the two year part replacement and upgrade option. Um,

Bobby (01:03:53):
It's like getting Apple care for an iPhone. You want to make sure like, if shit goes sideways, you're covered,

Jocelyn (01:03:58):
But fuck, that's so annoying having to ship your PC out every time. Even if you want to do like such a, like a minimal upgrade, like replay upgrade.

Bobby (01:04:06):
Yeah. You lose out on your PC for a little bit.

Nuru (01:04:08):
Yeah. Probably a couple of weeks, to be honest.

Bobby (01:04:11):
I mean, I can relate to that in my laziness though, where like, at the same time I see the major benefit of not having to deal with the problems.

Jocelyn (01:04:19):
Well, yeah, but I, I don't know. I'm I like tinkering. I like being the one to like, I like building things, you know?

Bobby (01:04:31):
Always.

Jocelyn (01:04:31):
Yeah. So I just like it. I don't know. That would just really, really annoy me. I think

Bobby (01:04:39):
Like crap, you'll hear the purest people out there who are like, Oh yeah, prebuilt PCs. Aren't the way to go. You want to build that PC yourself and know it in and out. It's the same stuff you get from people who are like big into cars. They're all about fixing their cars or selves because they want to know the ins and out of the car, you had the same exact type of people when it comes to computers. And the idea is they're like, if you build a PC yourself, odds are, you're going to know a lot more about how to fix an issue. If something goes wrong. Cause you know where everything's plugged in that where it connects, but it's not like necessary. It's not something you have to know.

Jocelyn (01:05:13):
I mean, but at the same time, do you really need to know the ins and outs of PC though? Like people that say that shit, I'm just like, but do you know the ins and outs of like windows 10 pro you don't, but it's on like your machine. So what's the, what's the difference really? Just like read your box, see what parts you have and do the reason. I just feel like people are just elitist for the sake of being an elitist and it's

Bobby (01:05:36):
Yeah. They want them, they want to put theirselves above somebody else. Like, Oh, you, you prebuilt your ESP.

Jocelyn (01:05:41):
It also goes into like console versus PC gamers too. It's also like a thing it's just fucking stupid.

Nuru (01:05:49):
So, I mean, also the other thing for this specifically is preference, right? Like, so like you guys said you like moving stuff and I mean, I enjoy building stuff myself and other aspects.

Bobby (01:06:01):
There's some things that you just don't want to have to do.

Nuru (01:06:03):
We have to deal with. Right. There's the same

Bobby (01:06:06):
Because I have been that's your prerogative. If you want to fix your car yourself, do you want to fix your computer yourself? You want to send it into a shop like you do what you're going to do. Like that's this year life.

Nuru (01:06:15):
So I guess, um, to segue this into, uh, potential, uh, custom builds, the price that we have here is 33 98. Um, what do you guys think you could accomplish with that bullshit from a custom built right?

Bobby (01:06:39):
33 98. And that's just the hardware, right? Like not monitors and stuff. That's 3,400 and GPU. Did you go with,

Nuru (01:06:57):
Uh, I don't think I splurged a ton on that. It was a 20, 60 RTX, 2066 gigabit, uh, gateway option.

Bobby (01:07:08):
I mean, we can already tell you we can get a 20, 80 for less than 3,400. We know that much just based on our current builds.

Jocelyn (01:07:16):
Yeah. Okay.

Nuru (01:07:18):
So I guess, are you guys comfortable with going into the price for your car?

Bobby (01:07:23):
Yeah, I can talk about mine. I don't thin most of the prices are kind of in the ether now because things are sold out and I can't see the exact prices, but just the hardware itself. But we're looking at like two grand range for my parts. And what I did is I have a Coursera liquid cooler. I have two core, it's an RGB liquid cooler that wasn't in the hundred range, I believe. And to RGB Corsair Ram sticks. They're not too bad. That relatively is a similar price to other ramps. Six you'll find out there, uh, the RTX 2080 GPU, which is probably when I bought it. It was in the, between seven, 800 range, somewhere around there, probably closer to mid sevens maybe. Uh, and then I have an I seven 8,700 K. So it's an eighth gen Intel and this is a good segue for the K. And so when you're looking at Intel CPU, you'll see things like, for example, mine, I have the 8,700 K if you could see a version that says seven 8,700 without the K. So for Intel CPU is when you see the K that's signifying that you can over clock that CPU. If you don't get a cave version, you're losing out on like overclock ability of the Intel CPU. And that those are the that's the bulk of what's inside my computer. I don't know if I missed out anything.

Jocelyn (01:08:53):
Alright. So I guess this is where I get to talk about how much mine costs. So a lot of these things, I'm going to have to do some math on the fly because I did upgrade some things since I've purchased it. So my overall price, um, it says here 13, 12, 18, which is a lie because is for some reason it has me on a 20, 70 super, and that's at least, well, that's like an additional $200 just on that. So, and then also my case isn't there. So I have spent around $2,100 on my build. You don't have to spend this much, but because I bought my [inaudible] plus mini ITX case, that case was $200 on its own, but I will go down, um, about the sex that I have. So, um, my CPU is an AMD rise in seven 3,700 X, 3.6 gigahertz, eight core processor.

Jocelyn (01:09:52):
And that is listed currently as two 74 49. Um, my CPU cooler is an NACOA and H and L a, um, am four CPU cooler. Um, which just means it's a low rise because it's a mini case that I couldn't have anything like huge and large, um, in my case, which is why I didn't use the fan that came with my CPU, um, that is $39 and 90 cents, which is the cheapest thing in my computer. Um, my mother board is actually in a S rock before 50 gaming, mini ITX motherboard. Um, and that costs one 84 94. My memory is now of course, their vengeance RGB pro 32 gigabyte and that's. So those are two 16 gigabytes of Ram and that costs $150. Um, storage is Seagate fire CUDA, two terabyte hybrid, internal hard drive for one 1988. Um, my SSD storage is Samsung nine 70 Evo 500 gigabytes. Um, and at was 99 99 video card. And the video G-Force RTX 2080 super, which is going to be $649 and 98 cents. Currently, I already said this about my cases at [inaudible] tower case, um, included six 50 Watts power supply. That was one 99 99 on Amazon. That case is currently no longer available apparently. And then I also had, uh, three serious Lupe, addressable RGB fans in my case with that came with my case. So, um, the prices aren't there, but I spent around $2,100 on mine.

Nuru (01:11:38):
Okay. So, I mean, uh, I guess all in, all on average, the, this might be some loose math here, but, um, it looks like the spend for the convenience is potentially, uh, a, uh, about like a thousand to 1400, uh, to go with the prebuilt option over building it yourself.

Speaker 6 (01:12:02):
I found some more specifics, so I can go over mine line by line, similar to Josh.

Jocelyn (01:12:06):
Oh, I thought you went line by line. Sorry.

Speaker 6 (01:12:09):
No, I, I was guessing while looking at my computer going, I think, I think that's what I bought.

Jocelyn (01:12:16):
Meanwhile, I came in here I'm like I got lists.

Speaker 6 (01:12:19):
Yeah. Then I saw you spitting out all like the specifics, like, Oh, I better start remembering. I bought,

Nuru (01:12:25):
I mean, she did build her a more recently. Right? That's true. That's true. Yeah.

Speaker 6 (01:12:32):
So I got the, uh, the I seven 8,700 K Intel CPU. Like I mentioned earlier, that ones cost me three 50. Uh, the CPU cooler is a Corsair eight 100, I RGB platinum. And that is a all in one liquid cooler. And that one was one 60 there. I got an MSI gaming edge XE, 33 90 M you know, they got these wild naming schemes. That was a $200 motherboard. The one thing I like about them on their board, a little segue here is you're not going to see it on every motherboard. I don't even know if it's specific to this MSI motherboard. They have a debugging system. So when you're first setting up your PC, they have these little red lights on the motherboard. And if your computer is not turning on, you can take a look at those red lights and they'll give you a hint as to what may not be working and what you need to look at.

Speaker 6 (01:13:25):
Like, are you having like a Ram issue or things like that when you're first trying to set up the computer, then for the Ram, I have two eight gig sticks. Of course, air vengeance, RGB pro that's DDR for 3000. For these speeds, specifics of it. I have a crucial MX 502 SSD for 500 gigs. That's the OSTP drive I have that one was $69. There is a two terabyte Seagate Barracuda drive that is just a normal HDD for about $60. A, the one price I don't have is the one terabyte SSD, Samsung Evo. I'm not too sure what the specifics of the price was on that off the top of my head, then we have the [inaudible] 88 gig card for the GPU. That was seven 80. When I bought it, I have a Corsair crystal to ADX. It's a micro ATX build case. So the benefit was, it's a smaller build area for the motherboard, but there's this like hidden compartment on the side where you can hide all the wires in a lifesaver for somebody who sucks at cable management like I do. Uh, and then I have a seven 50 watt power supply. So like I mentioned earlier, eight 50 watt. You're going to get more than enough. Cause I'm using seven 50 with an 2080 GPU. And then I have some Corsair LL one 40 RGB fans for the case. That's about four of them. And the total price is around $2,200.

Jocelyn (01:15:06):
I'm glad that you brought up cable management because that's such a strong topic as well. So how important is cable management to you? To the both of you? To me

Speaker 6 (01:15:19):
It's very important. And the laziest way I can get out of it, that's the best way for me, because it's so tedious to get it looking to the point where you look at your computer. You're not like, why did I do that? So with like how I said, I can hide like 90% of the cables in this hidden compartment, call it a day. It doesn't look bad when I look at my computer.

Nuru (01:15:39):
So you're talking about internally or externally.

Jocelyn (01:15:42):
Oh, we don't even want to talk about my cable management externally right there.

Speaker 6 (01:15:47):
I mean, I'm not like that. Look where the hard tube where you like the sleekness of the hard tube, look, we're talking like managing like your PSU cables, especially if you have like a glass pane.

Nuru (01:15:59):
Yeah. I mean, I feel like if you, yeah, yeah. I mean, I agree with that. Like you kind of no sense being able to see into your case if all you're seeing wires,

Speaker 6 (01:16:13):
But the more you make it look nice. It's also easier to deal with. Let's say you have to go back into the computer to change something. The better your cable management is the easier it is to get in and out of your system.

Nuru (01:16:24):
True. True, true. So, yeah, I mean, I agree. I mean, I agree too,

Jocelyn (01:16:30):
That is so important. Like if my cable management sucked don't, don't get me wrong. My cable management, and that's not the best because I still need to buy some more zip ties to get some things out of the way. But if my cable management wasn't at least decent, just upgrading, my Ram would have been an ordeal, a whole ordeal. Like actually the entire time I was in there, I was afraid I was going to unplug a fan and not remember what header I put it into. So

Nuru (01:17:00):
Take lots of pictures when building

Jocelyn (01:17:02):
Lots of pictures or if you're like me just stream it. Huh?

Speaker 6 (01:17:07):
Also side note, people may have done

Bobby (01:17:10):
This and their experience, but if you are making adjustments to your computer, like say unplugging, certain things, you do want to make sure the computer's off. Let's face it. Oh, I just said people that's all, I don't know, self incrimination.

Jocelyn (01:17:30):
Maybe I did it. I was tired. Okay. Um, my PC bills took me a very long time because I did some things stupidly and you know, prehaps, I did some things with it turned off, but I needed to see if things were working. It was stupid on my phone.

Bobby (01:17:53):
Um, what he was, was checking the fan. They were like, Oh yeah, the light turns on when I do that. And I double think I was like, wait a minute. Are you unplugging things while it's off?

Nuru (01:18:04):
Huh?

Jocelyn (01:18:07):
Oh yeah. Don't don't don't

Bobby (01:18:11):
Daddy lady get shocked

Nuru (01:18:14):
With it. Yeah,

Jocelyn (01:18:17):
That's correct. You'd be correct in saying that.

Nuru (01:18:22):
Um, I guess for each of you guys, and I guess I'll probably go with mine, um, after, but what makes you feel like Trump Shockley from like a feelings perspective? What makes you feel like a computer or a PC was worth it?

Jocelyn (01:18:42):
No, that's a good question for me. It's worth it because, well, my laptop was dying, so it was kind of, I was forced to either, you know, suck it up and bought like fix my laptop or buy a laptop or just take the dive and build a PC, which is something that I've been wanting to do for, I guess like maybe a year since Bobby started building his, it made me think maybe I should actually do it off the process. Yeah. He definitely didn't kick it off, but I feel like we do that to each other every time, like, I'll buy something, you're like, wait, I want that. Because it's like, we both trust each other. It's like taste and like technology. So we're like, maybe I should do the thing.

Bobby (01:19:29):
Yeah. It's like a headset. You're like, Oh, there's this headset on Amazon. I was like, Oh really? Huh?

Jocelyn (01:19:34):
He bought it like immediately, just immediately. Um, it was definitely worth it that, and you know, I really wanted to get into streaming for the longest time, but I just didn't have, I didn't have the resources to be streaming, um, with what I had currently and, you know, getting the laptop is kind of like got me into streaming and now I know more about hardware and it just kind of like, it just confirmed for me that I'm a total fucking computer dweeb because is building, it was really fucking fun. It was stressful. Don't get me wrong. It was the first time I, that I was doing. And I didn't, here's another thing not to do that. I did read the fucking manuals before you start building. I didn't do that. Uh, so it just confirmed.

Bobby (01:20:21):
So lean is important. Like I, myself, I stayed up way too late. I spent like two whole days just getting my computer working when I was building it. If you're trying to do shit while tired, it's just not going to work.

Jocelyn (01:20:34):
Yeah. Yeah. That was, that was really bad. We both did that though. At some point it was like three or four in the morning. I was like, okay,

Bobby (01:20:43):
I'm pleased in this thing. Right. It's really hard. I feel like this is probably a thing that developers in general face, um, was kind of hard to let go of solving problems in, um, halfway through. Or like when you get into that zone where like, I need to fix that. I need to fix it now. I can't do anything else until I fixed it.

Jocelyn (01:21:05):
Yeah. That's exactly. I get into that head space. I don't like leaving things unfinished and

Bobby (01:21:11):
I can't confirm this, but I've heard meditation is supposed to help with that. I can't confirm it. I've attempted it several times when I meditate. What am I doing again? I can hear creaking sounds. Is there somebody here focus on your toes so we can go from your toes.

Jocelyn (01:21:30):
They try to say like, you need to focus on that.

Bobby (01:21:32):
What isn't the cat doing? Right. Knocking here, here is a steady way to get rolled up balls too busy. Mediterranean. Somebody rolls up behind me, bam game over. Don't keep your eyes open.

Jocelyn (01:21:44):
We have descended into madness. Which probably means

Bobby (01:21:49):
What was Bobby's worth it. Yeah.

Jocelyn (01:21:51):
Yeah. What made it worth it for you?

Bobby (01:21:54):
I mean, it fit my lifestyle. I mean, my, I wouldn't be lying to say my, my life is heavily centered around technology, whether it's just general computer stuff, programming, playing video games. That is, that is the center of my Rhodes. I'm a daily, daily video game player, just general computer user and having a computer that fits the bill of what I'm looking for in terms of what it can do. Like I mess around with things like Photoshop on top and playing video games. So just having a workhorse level computer made sense. I know towards the end here is we've talked about like building a PC for general use in terms of just daily windows, computer, install, games, things like that. But there is a whole other world that you can look into where you build PCs to use as like personal servers. The parts are generally the same. You can usually go a little bit lower budget on it. Cause it's just going to be like a, a console server where like you log in with a command line type of deal and you can mess around with things like that.

Nuru (01:23:06):
Alright. Um, Oh, did we not want to talk about, uh, personal peripheral preferences? The triple P that's an old peripheral preference.

Jocelyn (01:23:20):
Yeah, because I can't say that word without making myself sound

Bobby (01:23:24):
Peripheral, peripheral, peripheral, peripheral. Let's talk about Dem perfs.

Jocelyn (01:23:30):
The purse. Yeah. Dumb purse. Yes. Let's talk about purse because I wanted, I really wanted to bring this up even though Nordeen brought it up because I forgot. Uh, because when people are setting up a budget for building APC, rarely do they factor in the cost of PPPs. Um, so your monitors, your keyboard, your mouse, like if you need to capture card, um,

Bobby (01:23:56):
P stands for fat personal peripherals.

Nuru (01:24:00):
That's my question. Right. Are, what are the, I guess let's not talk about us specifically, cause we might have some S interest cities in terms of what we splurged on. Um,

Bobby (01:24:16):
Like somebody's personal

Nuru (01:24:19):
For like the average person. What do you think are the things that they, from a peripheral perspective?

Jocelyn (01:24:27):
Well, sir, I just want to say we caught that shade. All right. We caught that. I know, I know it's like 90 degrees out right now, but we didn't need all that shade. We were fine.

Bobby (01:24:40):
[inaudible] electricity bills don't do that.

Nuru (01:24:42):
You guys would need to the shade. You know what I mean? I heard it in it.

Jocelyn (01:24:48):
So I do think though, like being serious, I do think that we should talk about what we do have set up because, um, maybe some people may be looking to getting into streaming or podcasting or, or just like, wants to know like what's a good monitor to have or what should I have for like a good like programming setup from home or something like that. I think we should go into that. But as far as when you say just a regular setup, I think that you should just have a really good monitor, um, from a non-gaming perspective and even a gaming perspective, you really need to have a really good monitor as now gaming comes, that's linked into like what your actual PC set up and stuff is sometimes like with what monitor you get. Um, I personally have like an MSI optics [inaudible] series, curved gaming monitor

Nuru (01:25:47):
Here, gang gang,

Jocelyn (01:25:47):
Gang, gang. Um, and that's because it, the refresh rate, it's like the highest it gets us one 65. And so I have a bill.

Nuru (01:25:56):
Yeah.

Bobby (01:25:58):
Yeah. I'm rocking a Dell monitor. It's it may be Dell, but it's 1440 monitor. It's got a higher refresh rate. So I can hit the one 40 for that, uh, for the general gaming purposes. So I may not do normal brand, but don't make some out monitors.

Jocelyn (01:26:14):
Do I? My second monitor is a dowel and I mean, if anything happened to this monitor, like perhaps I need to go ship it out for it to be replaced. Maybe that's still something I need to do. Uh, I can play on my Dell monitor and I wouldn't see like a, a drop or anything like that. Um, then of course a keyboard now.

Nuru (01:26:35):
Yeah. Let's dive into more peripheral

Bobby (01:26:39):
Real quick for monitors. You do want to be aware of the size of the monitor. Like I remember I bought my 27 inch monitor and when I took that thing out of the box, I was like, this is, this is fairly large. Where am I supposed to be?

Jocelyn (01:26:51):
Yeah, my monitor, my curved monitor, my MSI monitor is 32 inches. And uh,

Nuru (01:26:58):
I went with the 27 same, same brand, same family, but

Jocelyn (01:27:02):
Yeah, I know I did the 32 and don't get me. I mean, it's Purdy, it's real cute. But when I pulled it out of the box, I'm like, is this gonna fit on my, is this going to fit on my desk?

Nuru (01:27:13):
I guess my only, my only limit, the reason I opted to not go with 32, cause I had a 32 at a certain point was I felt like I was doing a decent amount of looking around. I'm like, you know what I mean? Which sounds weird to say, but I'm like, yeah, I want to be able to take in most of the primary information without having to, you know what I mean, look to the left or right. And that was why I kind of felt like 27 was the sweet spot for me. And I mean, I guess it depends. Um, maybe I've got [inaudible] yeah. The way

Bobby (01:27:55):
Are you, are you from your mind or new roof? Well, let me get real close here for a second.

Nuru (01:28:02):
Sure, sure. That's another thing to consider, I guess, Josh, do you want to finish your big batch streaming set up so that I can, uh, we can at various points going to our associated less big batch?

Jocelyn (01:28:15):
Yeah. I'm going to try to go from most important things to things that aren't really important or needed at all. Um, so then I have my keyboard now keywords are a hot topic as well. I could probably

Bobby (01:28:33):
You two are keyboard phonetics. Yeah.

Jocelyn (01:28:35):
Yeah. So we probably could do an entire episode just about mechanical keyboards and that we may do that actually

Bobby (01:28:43):
Could, you could do an episode on key cap with the way you guys are under that stuff.

Jocelyn (01:28:48):
Talk about it. Yes. Okay. We could don't drag us too hard, Bob.

Bobby (01:28:53):
I mean, I have, I had my own stuff. I could probably do a whole show about art and stuff.

Jocelyn (01:28:57):
I mean, we're, we're going to get to the stuff you got. Don't worry, don't worry. But, um, so my keyboard, I have an 80% keyboard and it's an eco X ducky keyboard collaboration. Um, if you don't care about the way your keyboard looks or you don't care about, If you don't care about this stuff, you don't, you could just buy whatever keyboard, you know, but

Bobby (01:29:27):
Good old logic tech keyboard. They do. Like I had one, um, back when I was a plebe.

Jocelyn (01:29:38):
Yeah. But now, um, so this keyboard is all pink. Um, and it's amazing. I love it. It's um, side printed on the key caps so that when you're looking at it from above the key caps appear blank. But obviously if you're sitting in front of it, it's flutters are on there. Now this was $90. You don't need to spend $90 on a keyboard, but I am just a sucker for customization. I'm a sucker for colors and all of those great things. So that's why I have that. Now when we are starting to get into, I want to say gaming specific PPPs, um, I'm kind of like a razor fan girl. I'm actually a Razer affiliate. So I have a lot of racist things. Yeah. It is a plug because, you know,

Bobby (01:30:29):
And, uh, Lincoln was a scripture

Jocelyn (01:30:31):
Coding link and my Twitch link will be in the description as well. Look, we're out here. I'm trying to let y'all know. Um, so my mouse I've always had razor mice. Um, I had a Razer Naga mouse, which is like a mobile specific, um, because it has all of the key bindings on the side. And I love that when I was meaning league of legends was just fucking years ago. But for the past three years, I've had a razor Mambo wireless and I love it. Um, it's amazing. This mouse, when I got it, one 80 probably bought that on sale. I think I bought it on sale. It's to me it's necessary, especially when you are gaming and you're spending a lot of time on your computer and you need a decent mouse to play with. And I think it's worth splurging on it. Maybe you don't necessarily need to spend the 200 or something dollars that I did, but

Bobby (01:31:31):
I think it depends on the game. All right. If you're playing any type of FBS, your mouth also depends on the size of your hand. Not all mouses really feel well, depending on how big or small the hand

Jocelyn (01:31:44):
Mice are created, the same

Bobby (01:31:48):
There's compatibility issues.

Jocelyn (01:31:50):
It's true. Now you could probably get like a decent, I would think you would get, it could get a decent like gaming mouse. Cause I know a lot of like professional FPS players, they have like a very basic amounts or just like, as long as the tracking's good on this, I really don't care.

Bobby (01:32:04):
They're gone for lightweight and good tracking.

Jocelyn (01:32:08):
Yeah. So that's fine. And usually they're like 60 or $70, but you're still, you're still putting out money for that. Okay.

Nuru (01:32:14):
The final mouse, I have this, this, this after a resale

Bobby (01:32:20):
Easy level where they're like, yo, you gotta, you gotta enter a route.

Nuru (01:32:24):
Yeah. It's like 300 or $300 now apparently. So cash out.

Jocelyn (01:32:29):
So moving along from my mouth, I'm more razor surprise. I also suggest, um, because you know, I game, I also got an extended mousepad. That's also racer and, and it's the razor Goliath, extended chroma mat, which means that it's RGB and it's pink. I don't even know.

Nuru (01:32:54):
Is it full desk or, uh,

Jocelyn (01:32:56):
It's full it's full desk. It's almost full desk because I like having

Nuru (01:33:02):
This, uh, room.

Jocelyn (01:33:04):
I like having the room. I like not having to like readjust every time I'm going to aim or something like I can just slide across the desk, cover it.

Bobby (01:33:13):
I see more mouse bait. You have the better, you can't really have too much mouse space unless it's going over, unless it's over going over the desk and you just got to be angling, then that's a little, yeah,

Jocelyn (01:33:24):
We're not, we're not here for that. But this smells pad costs. Oh my gosh, I think $40. So

Bobby (01:33:32):
Yeah, you can get it ended mouth pads cheap.

Jocelyn (01:33:34):
So, and with RGB, so it syncs up to everything. I feel, I feel like that's kind of cool. It's going even further in to ridiculousness prehaps I have the razor headstand also in court position, which is pink has RGB on the bottom. And maybe that was $50. I cannot confirm or deny it's not that bad. But then when we get to the stream, the capture card, I mean, uh, so I also have the razor capture card. Uh that's because I was doing a dual PC streaming situation. I'm no longer doing that since I upgraded the Ram in my initial PC, but I'm still going to be using that because I do think I'm going to start streaming like animal crossing. Yeah. And so that costs $200.

Bobby (01:34:23):
The secrets were being revealed this pocket.

Jocelyn (01:34:25):
Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah,

Bobby (01:34:27):
You guys got the inside scoop

Jocelyn (01:34:31):
And then I also have a stream deck. I have the 16 key stream deck. This is probably where, I mean,

Bobby (01:34:37):
What does the stream deck do? Mystery?

Jocelyn (01:34:40):
You can do everything. You can program the stream, deck buttons to work on anything on your computer. Like I have programmed it to a lot of my Twitch binds are programmed on this. I have Spotify programmed onto my stream deck as well. Although not through the API that is through the stream deck, like app store. I just went ahead and set it up myself because I was tired of hitting the API and it, it being limited re

Speaker 6 (01:35:03):
Yeah. Throttle, throttle, throttle.

Jocelyn (01:35:06):
And I'm just like, dude, upgrade your API key or something. What are you doing anyway? So, and then also, um, I have like my vs code button on there. I also have it programmed to like compile with a certain project and I'm on personal projects because I'm unemployed. So it can compile just by pressing a button, which is really nice. Um,

Speaker 6 (01:35:31):
Perfect projects are the fun projects anyway.

Jocelyn (01:35:33):
Yeah, exactly. But then you can also like set it up to, like, I know there, you can set up to Phillips hue, like those light bulbs that Bobby has, you do have to

Speaker 6 (01:35:43):
It's time for my episode. Yeah.

Jocelyn (01:35:46):
Let's let's let's and that's a great segue for Bob to talk about what he has.

Speaker 6 (01:35:52):
So I actually have somewhat similar stuff for in peripherals in terms of like the streaming setup. It sounds, I do eventually I plan on getting into streaming myself cause I've been told many times I should, as well as it seems like it could be fun to do so, but in terms of general keyboard talk, I went with more of the just general use keyboard purchase instead of the customized, like key caps and all that. So I got a, a Corsair RGB keyboard that just matched the color scheme of my computer tower in the boujee fashion that I liked to do. And Coursera in general, uh, the company-wise they, most of the peripheral stuff you get from Coursera, you're not going to have a lot of problems with it. Their IQ software can be finicky at times, but in general, it's pretty solid. I used to have a, I started with a razor mouse similar to, well, same exact one. Jocelyn ran with the raise of Mamba, much like how he has the same laptop at the same given time, we almost had like the exact same setup and raise your mouth is, are solid. And I always liked the razor mouse until when I built my PC, since that mouth was already preexisting, I got a Corsair mouse just to match the color scheme, which like the keyboard. But I honestly would not recommend that mouse.

Jocelyn (01:37:06):
And just to interject a little bit, that's the one thing that does annoys me about razor is that they have put the court's edition on my site, you know, or okay. But when it comes to their like more expensive mice, like the one I have, obviously the reason mom, but it's just in black, like, can we get, can we get colors? Can I get a court's edition razor Mamba?

Speaker 6 (01:37:26):
Yeah. When it comes to ranger, you're relying on their RGB chroma stuff to provide any customization. That's just accent.

Jocelyn (01:37:34):
I'm like razor, can I have that? Okay, sorry.

Speaker 6 (01:37:38):
But the mouse, the Coursera mouse that I said, I wouldn't recommend that is the [inaudible] RGB elite. Cause at least me personally, it doesn't happen to everybody. But I honestly, when I was on the internet, it happened to a lot of people is the core. Sarah mouse had this problem where eventually you are click would stop

Bobby (01:37:56):
Registering on a majority of scenarios, which ignoring gaming, even just general computer work. You don't want to have your left click, just stop working. Like every other time you click the mouse. And that happens for me, like to two mouses in a row for that 65. So I mentioned course there is not a terrible company. They do have a majority of good things. Just that one mouse I'd avoid personally based on my own

Jocelyn (01:38:22):
Fuck, that mouse is what he said

Bobby (01:38:26):
Because I got the Corsair keyboard. I got a cooler, I got RGB. I got a bunch of chorus and stuff, but that mouse, no, sir. What is your favorite gaming mouse so far? Do you have one that stands out in your mind is like, I like this. I went back to razor. Cause I guess just the general shape of the razor mouse. Well, in my hand, or is it a different one this time I went with the razor death adder. I believe it's called the death that are read to now. Overall, it's a simple mouse. It's just got your normal scroll wheel. It's got your DPI buttons in the middle of behind the scroll wheel pen on the thumb side, it's got your forward and backward button. So it's not one of those like heavily programmable mouses, but mice, no words, English things, but it's got a decent weight. The cable it's a wired mouse, but not wireless. And the cable is very lightweight. So moving the mouse around, I don't feel any tugging or anything. It's almost like the cables barely even there. And in general, it's just, it's, it's a simple enough mouse to use and it feels good in the hand.

Jocelyn (01:39:31):
I mean, I know I'm a racer affiliate or whatever, but I will say they're not sponsoring this podcast because still I don't have any sponsors, but they make really, they know how the fucking mate mice they do. They didn't do. They do know how to make those very, very well. So I highly suggest them for anything. They are pricey, but to me worth it,

Bobby (01:39:50):
The last main peripheral I could probably talk about would be the monitor. So technically I have two monitors. I'm, I'm a big proponent of multiple monitors mainly cause I have a lot of stuff going on and they gave a point. So I like when I'm playing games, if sometimes when I'm playing by myself, I like having a TV show up on the side or something like that. I know some people, they got like their, their major office rooms are like, Oh, I got an actual TV next to my computer. Hang on. I've just got a simple monitor to the left of mine.

Jocelyn (01:40:15):
We know how you like having other things up because

Bobby (01:40:17):
I had a 10 ADP monitor. But then when I went full bougie mode on my computer and I decided I was going to step up the resolution a little bit, that's when I ended up getting the 1440 P a high refresh rate monitor to just make sure when I'm playing games at the higher settings that I would eventually be playing at, I'm getting the most bang for my buck in terms of being able to actually hit the high part of the high end and not just be like, Oh, I can barely run high graphics settings at 1440 P. I wanted to make sure I could comfortably run high graphics settings at 1440 P. And that's the majority of my main peripherals that I'm running, despite the fact that

Nuru (01:40:54):
You guys were like, you don't really have a budget. Most of your bills came in kind of like in my price range really? Right. Cause 22 and 2100. So that's like perfectly doable. It's like not crazy.

Jocelyn (01:41:11):
[inaudible] that peripherals, it definitely goes into like three grand territory.

Nuru (01:41:15):
I mean, I guess for me, I kind of have the peripherals that can handle more than what I'm using them for.

Jocelyn (01:41:21):
Yeah. You already got the higher refresh rate in one,

Nuru (01:41:24):
For me, I pretty much have the 27 inch version of the same monitor. Jaws has keyboard wise. I've built a couple throughout the years, but the one that I have stuck with for the games that I'm playing now is the 60%. Docie one too many, got the custom Arco slash ducky crossover, key cap and pink and purple apps. Some custom, I believe their hyper X WASD keys that are tilted. Cause I kinda like the, being able to tell where my WSD keys are by feel because I'm a forgetful person. Also, I have a custom, a few custom keys, my escape, and my three are from company called hotkeys project that does limited release custom keycaps. And this build, I like the feedback has got the cherry MX Brown switches. So I've got tactile feedback, but also not too loud. So that's my key board from a mouse perspective, a mouse that I have liked and hasn't done me wrong at least so far has been the lotta tick five Oh two [inaudible] gaming mouse.

Nuru (01:42:40):
Um, it's a bit on the higher side in terms of button, uh, additional buttons. You know, I play a lot of Fortnite currently, so that tends to come and useful for me. Um, I recently swapped from the wired edition, um, to now I'm using the wireless option, which I definitely recommend for anybody that's thinking about that has the, uh, former, um, cause you know, the, the cable on the G the original G five Oh two is plenty, not the best in terms of, uh, getting snapped and hooked on stuff and not having a mouse bungee. Um, so I know other keyboards though, that I've played around with are the end pro to, uh, 60%. Um, I liked that, um, because it has a built in Bluetooth wireless option that you can use. Uh, but that's not my daily driver. I tend to use that in the office or, um, for work related stuff. Cause it has for our 60% keyboard, it has he's that alternate as arrow keys, which most 60% don't do necessarily, but I do fault, but those

Bobby (01:43:52):
Are the things that like, Oh, and other custom peripheral, I can't forget to mention is my Funko pop. Always gotta have it there. You know, there's some delicious in there. So yeah, you're a mouse talker. Monomy of a mouse I forgot to mention is since it's one that I rarely use something on play a lot of like mobile style games anymore, but I have a Coursera mouth that I don't have an issue with. And that is the chorus air Symitar mouse, which is specifically branded towards mobile. Cause it's one of those ma mice that has a high number of like grid style keys, where the thumb is. So this one specifically has actual 12 little buttons that inside the IQ system, you could customize the key binds of those buttons to trigger a specific action. So let's say in a game where you have like abilities on an ability bar, you have like all E as the trigger action for that ability, you can set one of those 12 buttons to be that key bar. And so that way you can more easily access certain things in a like high action style game where it's not just like a point shoot FPS game.

Jocelyn (01:45:11):
Yeah. That's what the Razer Naga is. And that's why I had it when I played league of legends, because it was just, it's necessary to have one of those, my league, to be honest. Yeah.

Bobby (01:45:23):
One of the benefits of the seminar was you can move the key pad too, so you can kind of slide it. It's a minimal movement area, but you can still move it forward and backward to get the best positioning for where your hand is.

Jocelyn (01:45:35):
And that's what she said.

Bobby (01:45:39):
I was surprised. Nobody said that when I said it feels good in the hand, I thought we were trying to stay away from a that's what she said.

Jocelyn (01:45:51):
It's been new. They've been new with, this was this one.

Bobby (01:45:56):
Cause after that Al you up up there and it was silent, I was like, okay, that's, that's where we are.

Jocelyn (01:46:02):
Oh no, we, um, but okay. I think, I think that we've, unless I'm wrong that we've covered everything that encompasses building a PC. And then some,

Bobby (01:46:20):
Maybe we could probably just go with more of a summary at this point. Just the basic points of comparing pre-bill versus building your own PC and just what to generally be aware of.

Jocelyn (01:46:31):
Okay girl, then you go ahead and start.

Bobby (01:46:36):
Okay. When you're like just general choice, if you're looking between prebuilt or a custom build, either way, you're going to want to do your research. You don't want to just trust in what some websites you like. Oh, here's what the Bill's gonna look like in the end. And then just buy the parts here. And don't be like somebody on the internet where you go to like a forearm or Reddit or some other site where like, Oh, I bought this. It was my purchase. Good. I mean, at that point, I mean, yeah, it'd be nice to know you've got a bad purchase, but you want to ask those types of questions to whoever you're asking them to before you actually make any purchases. And that's the biggest thing. Cause like prebuilt versus custom, either way, you're going to end up with a computer. You just want to make sure you actually research. What's going to be inside that computer. That's the key portion of doing either of the two neither one's right or wrong. As long as you put the research.

Jocelyn (01:47:30):
Yeah, definitely agree. Put in the research and honestly just pick whatever is comfortable for you. If you're comfortable with building your PC, by all means, do it. And or, and if you're not comfortable building a PC on your own and want somebody else to do that for you and take on that risk, then

Bobby (01:47:47):
Do that. Bob, the builder, if you have a friend who likes building PCs, I mean, you could always talk to them, see if they could help out turn that into an activity.

Jocelyn (01:47:58):
Yeah. Pay us and alcohol and pizza and we'll build it for you. Just say

Bobby (01:48:04):
That'll be three 50,

Jocelyn (01:48:06):
Three 50 tree fitting in the beer,

Bobby (01:48:11):
All the above.

Jocelyn (01:48:13):
Okay. When we said, well, pay us in pizza and beer. Were you meant specifically to Nero? Is anybody outside of this? No. You need to pay me actual money

Bobby (01:48:22):
Friend people that, you know what I mean? Like doing that and are willing to trade their skills for, uh, money or food. Um, other, any kind of sustenance, emotional war. We're not going to ask you to call anybody out, but any friend that tells you that clean is not important. Cause uh, yeah. So that's one thing we probably didn't really mention too much airways for your cooling. So what are you gonna do if you buy a prebuilt? There's a certain level of trust that I guess is implied. You have to trust that they put the cooling fans, but when you're building your own computer itself from this, from the start, you want to make sure the fans are placed correctly on the case for whether or not you want the air being pulled into the computer or being kicked out of the computer. And you also want to position these fans in a way from like front to back so that there's some air being pulled in from somewhere and a different set of fans are kicking that air out. So you want to make sure the air flow actually helps keep the inside. Cool. And you're not just sucking air out or sucking it. Right?

Nuru (01:49:48):
My personal question is how do you guys feel about Funko pops in the case?

Bobby (01:49:55):
Well, what's the melting temperature

Nuru (01:49:59):
And I just see somebody has a built where it's like a Vagita Funko pop, like in the thing. I just thought it,

Jocelyn (01:50:05):
He must not care about that. Funko pop.

Bobby (01:50:09):
Like how hot can they actually get,

Nuru (01:50:11):
Oh, the phone balls. That's the question. All right.

Bobby (01:50:14):
Somebody was complaining about this on the internet. A large majority of figurines are made out of PVC, which melts at around 100 Celsius. So if you don't got proper cooling in that CPU, you're not have a melted figurine. Do your

Jocelyn (01:50:29):
All over your GPU. No,

Bobby (01:50:34):
I know Funko pops are fairly light, but why would you want to put any extra weight on top of the parts that are in your computer?

Nuru (01:50:46):
You had a fairly big case. So I think there was like a lot of extra space in there for the picture to be honest. And he removed it

Jocelyn (01:50:56):
Gram, but I just feel like, why would you want to put anything inside of a cake? Like something that you just spent, literally thousands of dollars on. Why would you want to put anything extra in there? That's not meant for your PC to run? You know what I mean?

Nuru (01:51:13):
Well, actually it was this fajita. No, this is a homeboy from a tech and a J cause

Bobby (01:51:19):
When, when new, who does mention having to like a lot of space in your case, that brings up a side note that could have been brought up around a cable management time is like, if you buy a bigger tower and you have a lot of space inside, like working within that build and like cable management in general becomes a lot less stressful. Cause you're not like squeezing around certain parts of the computer. But if you go to a smaller form factor, there's a chance you could run into just personal headaches where like you have to be like this squealing two fingers into a certain area. Cause like you're not going to be able to reach your whole hand around certain parts of the bill, the cable management. I had the same problem though. Cause this is, this is, you know, I mean, if I throw up an alley, Oop, sometimes somebody got Duncan

Jocelyn (01:52:06):
Bitch. I will always die. You hear me? I will always done.

Bobby (01:52:11):
Ashley was like, I played center on basketball.

Jocelyn (01:52:14):
I couldn't play no, I could not play basketball. They wanted me to because I was tall, but okay. I think we're running off topic

Bobby (01:52:26):
Where the content lives,

Nuru (01:52:28):
There's the random risks.

Jocelyn (01:52:30):
So hopefully y'all liked our episode on PC building and all the things that we have talked about this episode or a wide array of things. But um, as always, if you have any comments or concerns, feel free to email me@thecutepodcastsatgmail.com or you can always find me on Twitter. My personal Twitter is at so and so's and then the podcast Twitter is the get cute podcast. I would like to thank Bobby and new roof for recording this podcast with me after I forced them to take in a couple of weeks, we got here. What?

Nuru (01:53:11):
But I'm blinking three times right now. That's my signal. You gotta, you gotta call three times. That's how you do it.

Jocelyn (01:53:20):
As always, if you enjoyed this podcast, please feel free to leave me a review wherever you're listening to this Apple podcast, Spotify, Stitcher, et cetera, et cetera. I am everywhere. And as always black lives fucking matter. And uh, we sell she you or I will see you. I don't know about these two.

Nuru (01:53:42):
We're not being brought back. Our contract is not more than one episode. Our probation period did not go well. We apologize for misleading. Okay. Bye [inaudible].
