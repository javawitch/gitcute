**Jocelyn**:
Hello and welcome to the season 2 trailer for Git Cute Podcast. My name is Jocelyn. I am a software engineer, and also the host of Git Cute Podcast. Git Cute is a podcast that is for anyone that is tired of listening to tech podcasts that are humdrum, full of technical jargon, and have no real integration to the real humans that produce code. Season 2 starts on Monday, May 18th. If you subscribe right now, the episode will be immediately available into your podcast feed. So make sure to subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts. You know, like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Music Podcasts. Uh, honestly, I forget where this is, but you know, it's everywhere. 

I'm so excited for you all to listen and just know that talking about tech does not have to be stuffy, but it can always be cute. 

See ya Monday. Bye!
