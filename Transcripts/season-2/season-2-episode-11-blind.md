Welcome back everyone to Git Cute! We haven't done a lot of these this season as far as me diving into subject with a lot of resources and things like that a lot of it has been, you know supplied and supplemented with my own experience and knowledge

Just fine. But we are getting back into the, you know, research type of thing, because these are the types of topics that make me really happy and giddy. I know in previous episodes, I talked about doing an episode on big note, big O notation, which is still on the roster, I do still have, like half of that transcript on. But this coming up was just a lot more interesting to me. And, you know, as one does, I was perusing Reddit, and I saw this post in the subreddit, CS career questions. And, you know, it was actually a post that made me start thinking and it made me start thinking about where I am posting my data, what type of social media platforms I'm using, and do we really know what these companies are doing with the data that we provide them? The answer is no. I mean, we're fortunate enough to be in a technical fields. So we have a good understanding of what's going on with their data and understanding giving your data, what trade offs you're having and that sort of thing. But oftentimes, the general population doesn't know what's going on with their data. And that is no problem.

But you know what, it's this is just really interesting to me. And I thought, why the hell not do an episode about the app Blind.

But before we get into the actual content of that, and talking about how problematic the name of the app is, I do want to say thank you to everyone that has been leaving the reviews and everything for get q podcast on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening to get cute where you're able to leave a review in a comment and has been helping me out a lot. We've been up and down the charts over the past. I want to say four weeks. It's been absolutely a wild ride and I appreciate y'all so much.

Supporting. If you missed last week's episode, I am running a contest where I am giving away an interview bundle that has a lot of books that I like. And also a productivity planner which helps with interview prep and then also just using on a day to day for

figuring out job tasks for myself and that is available and if you want to know the rules and everything like that, I did talk about that in the last episode. And also if you follow the podcast on Twitter, which is at get cute podcast then you will be able to share all of that information as well and get into the contest because I believe I'm going to be running it for like another week or so before cutting off announcing the winner and then sending out the gifts and the goodies. How exciting.

What else do I need? Oh, yeah, I'm designing t shirts. I

Designing a T shirt, maybe a sweatshirt, and I'm designing things that I like to wear. And I may be designing socks because I know a lot of tech people are kind of over t shirts, but I still love them. I love t shirts and sweatshirts. And I'm trying to see if I can provide a variety of sizes for the T shirts and sweatshirts, because I know that is such a huge part of not liking t shirts, because honestly the ranges that most companies and conferences that we go to give are not great, they're not good. So I don't want to be part of that problem.

But also, I like the idea of designing socks because I don't want to design to slake a logo and a sock that's kind of off I want to design a pattern. I just got to figure out what type of pattern I would like and what colors offer and things of that nature and to also not go overboard and order a bunch of socks and then nobody buy them.

I rambled enough. I think I have. Yeah, let's let's get into talking about Blind.

All right, as usual, with this podcast, I want to be very clear and open about the resources that I have used here. So my main resource, of course, was the post on subreddit, CS career questions, which is a post by public agency 6912. And by the way, I do contact this user yesterday when I realized that I wanted to do an episode

about this particular post topic, but they didn't reach out to me in time for a yay or nay. But then I went ahead and research the user and it is a throwaway account that they have for this. So in no way am I outing them or

you know, risking their non movie

in the sense of saying her username but I did want to give them credit for this because they're the

One sec made me go through the deep dive of even figuring out what was going on. Um, and then also, the other resource is going to be wikipedia.org. And I need to tell y'all that I have quite literally read every single article that are listed in the bibliography as resources for the Blind Wikipedia listing. I'm quite serious. I've read all of them.

So if you want the full list of resources, please go to the Blind Wikipedia listing and check out all of the articles that I went through there.

Okay, so the interesting thing about this Yes, career questions post wasn't necessarily that the fact that they were posting about it, I think that was the first time I'd seen Blind being posted about it MCs career questions. But the question that public agencies 6912 freezed was

About the legitimacy of Blind, do we trust Blind is what they asked actually. And furthermore, I'm going to build on top of that and ask if we do then why. And it's such an interesting question, because when I was introduced to Blind, I was still working at my former company who shall not be named. And, um, I was actually introduced to it by coworkers. Because obviously, I think at that time, I was starting to try to figure out

where I wanted to go as far as a company. And you know, Glassdoor can only give you so much context, as far as what the company is because a lot of those reviews are left by people that have left the company and a lot of them skew negative. So you're not sure how serious you can take those reviews.

Anyhow, so somebody told me about Blind and yes, we can talk about how problematic blinds name is, I hate it. It's completely ablest.

It's a terrible name. But anywho I downloaded the app I signed up. And for those of you that do not have the app,

it I know for a fact it's available on iOS. I'm not sure if it's available on Android, but I wouldn't see how it could not be. It's not anything that I feel is so shouldn't be cross platform.

When you sign up for an account, you have to use your work email. And

I will admit that when I first saw that I was a bit hesitant, but also I was in a mind space, where I was just like, Oh, yeah, fuck it, take this email address. I don't care. Um,

so that's the thing so they have my old work email address for my Blind account. I probably won't be making a new Blind account with my current work email address actually haven't even gotten that yet. So don't worry, don't worry, new company. I'm not gonna be doing that. Um, but

You have to sign up with your work email, which is fine. And I didn't really think too much about it. And I went ahead and did it. And it brings a really good point about what sort of data we're allowing these applications to have. And

I feel as though from a security standpoint, there's always that risk that leaks are going to happen. I mean, obviously, over the last, primarily over the last year to two years, we've seen a lot of security leaks, a lot of huge security leaks

that have impacted the public and a tremendous matter. And I feel as though that

as consumers as application users, we need to be more aware of what data we're giving away and what these companies are actually doing with the information that we give them. And although it's starting to slowly roll along, and

As far as state and federal legislature within the United States, I don't think that we currently have

representatives of the population that are too well versed in what

we what's going on with technology. I'm trying to say this in the best way.

And I'm also not trying to make this extremely political

episode, but that it's the truth that we don't have representation or a lot of representation that

deals with technology outside of phones, emails, that sort of thing. So we need to start becoming aware of that. And what are the implications of an app like Blind having those emails and what happens if a leak happens? So needless to say Blind did have a security breach and those email addresses did bleak here. I'm going to refer

An article by Zack Whittaker written for TechCrunch. The title is at Blind a security lapse revealed private complaints from Silicon Valley employees. What if it's server storing user data and messages was exposed without a password?

That's kind of major, you know.

For those of you that don't know the background of Blind before I started researching for this episode, I didn't know about it either. Blind is actually a South Korean funded company. And it's made its way into the US market in 2015. So originally, this applications with us in South Korea on you and us by major tech companies within the country. And then in 2015, it quickly came over here and started being used for even bigger tech companies in the US, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Uber. You think of a tech company, your company's probably in there, I promise you. So here's the interesting thing in 2018

To the exposed server, according to Whittaker, as he writes was found by security researcher who goes by the name of sock H, inform the company of the security lapse. So

this wasn't even something that was found by say somebody within the company on an unnecessarily wasn't hacked in the sense for good or bad. I couldn't find any additional information about Moosa Ah, and who they were. And if they were actually just happened upon it. So apparently, it to give you some more information about the leak. Blind was using Kibana dashboards for its Elasticsearch database. And of course, databasing had a lot of tables within that including private messaging data and web based content for both of the US and Korean sites that it had.

Blind did say that the exposure only affected users who signed up or logged in

between November 1 and December 19. And that exposure relates to a single server one among many servers on our platform according to Blind executive Kim Kim and in email. I am practically reading the article right now because there's not much that I can do to reword it to make it my own when they kind of woodworkers done all the work for me here.

So, the funny thing is that I find really interesting it in this point, is that

Tech Crunch had to follow up with Blind a week after the alleged leak. And that was the only and only then with a TechCrunch follow up did Blind pull the database had been affected. And then the company began emailing its users on Thursday after TechCrunch asked for comment according to Whitaker in the article Um, so that's not surprising. We've also seen a lot of companies hide the fact that they

There's been a breach for an extremely long amount of time, actually, maybe a year or two at most. And I'm not sure quite sure why

they're allowed to do that I was under the impression that if a breach happens with consumer data that they needed to be told immediately about that. Now granted, I understand that when suddenly like this happens, there is a lot of research that has to go into it. Well, first research going into it about what exactly happened Second, the actual fix for this which involves us a long series of phone call,

with everybody pretty much within the organization, including a executives in the C suite, and then pushing that fix, and then having legal and HR try to make it not seem as bad as it is but granted any leak is is about

leak. So I don't necessarily like the the stance that Blind took about this leak, which makes me worry that something like this could absolutely

happen again in the future, we may not know it

would occur and TechCrunch did their own research because they found and I'm quoting this from the article that the database provided a real time stream of user logins, user posts, comments and other interactions, allowing anyone to read private comments and posts. The database also revealed the encrypted private messages between members but not their associated email addresses.

And then they go on to say that they are obviously not giving screenshots or any data because it's highly sensitive and it's

in no way going to help for this article. I have been on for myself, so this is interesting because one of blinds now just to remind everyone, this article

research was conducted in 2018. So within the article with a current TechCrunch actually give a link to an archive FAQ s on Team blinds website. And so I decided to forego that and go on to Team blinds FAQs myself and see what the heck they're talking about as far as privacy and security is concerned. So the one two things that I'm actually concerned about are Can I be identified if I join Blind, the only information that's required when joining is an email address? emails are one way hash salted and encrypted. Accounts are stored on a separate server from hashed email addresses. This proves to be true considering that they database that was actually hacked into in 2018. They actually had plain text email addresses but I see that they've actually hashed email addresses which is what you should do when you're storing email addresses in a database. I continue back to what is on Team Blind. This means

Such activity will never be connected to your email, your name will never sorry, Your name will not even be connected to your account. Since we never asked for this information. In short, it will be anonymous even to our team members.

That also seems to be the exact same database design that they had in 2018 when this breach happened, because also none of that has changed. The only thing that has changed as far as that entire system is the fact that they're now hashing the email addresses instead of just storing them as plaintext, which again, I will reiterate is what you should be doing with the database anyway.

Naturally, I became even more curious about wind and this type of authentication system that they were running when I installed that they have a US patent, a US patent. That's really cool. And the best thing about US patent is that it's available

To the public so you can exactly see what is going on. So we're going to dive into their system and method authentication to see if Blind is truly safe to use. Which Honestly, I can't do that much from just reading a patent for an authentication system since we don't know what kind of a corruption and security clinic security for the developers because we've seen that be a problem more than once this year. Twitter, they have on the rest of their application system, but let's pretend that the rest of that is perfect. You can't see me but I am doing air quotes right now, when I said perfect. So word for word, the abstraction on their US patent

is this provided is a system and method for authentication. The method includes receiving a subscription request from a user terminal. The subscription requests executed by the authentication server communicating with the user terminal and including group discrimination data

Including a group code and information for discriminating a group from another.

If it is determined that the group code and information included in the group discrimination data correspond to each other, performing a group authentication procedure on the user terminal and processing the group authentication procedure is being successful. issuing a member session key to the user terminal and providing a service requested by the user terminal and response to the service requests including the member session key from the user terminal and one embodiment it is possible to prevent information on service users from being divulged.

Before we go on, let me give you the patent number just in case any of you want to look up this patent yourself and read along. It is US Patent 943907, to be two. So not gonna lie. The first time I read that abstract, I was like, Ha, second time I was like, definitely Ha. Third time reading it to y'all. I'm so confused. However, there are more details.

available for us patents that they obviously need to know. So this part of information which I'm not going to read entirely in full Otherwise, this episode is going to be an extremely long process. It helped me understand what exactly was going on. Essentially, I read to you the first couple of lines to see if y'all will get it together and then I'll explain it how I believe that they are running this authentication process and then

we'll Kiki and try to figure it out.

And non transitory, computer readable medium with instructions stored therein, which upon execution, instruct at least one processor to receive a subscription request from a user terminal, the subscription request, including a group code and a plain text email address, store the plain text email address included in the subscription request and a table for subscription. When the group code in the plain text email correspond to each other, perform a group authentication procedure on the user terminal and processing the group authentication procedure as being successful. When the group authenticates.

procedure for the user terminal is processed successfully. issue an authentication authentication key, I can't speak for the subscription or class and store the authentication key in a table for subscription, transmit the authentication key to the user terminal. And there's a lot more that's going on there. But what I'm seeing is, is that they are giving a group code so that way you can't single out one user from the other. Especially if you don't have access to the email address, the email address is going to be stored in hash in a separate table. So if all you have in this current table with the user terminal is usually terminal or class and then also the group code.

They're saying that there's no possible way for you to be identified, which honestly, I don't know. Apparently no one else has thought of that because they have a US patent for it. I would like to know more about that, but I don't have the time to dig into that any further.

To me, it makes it seem plausible that I wouldn't be able to be identified. However, the breech and 2018 is making me think that the main issue is making sure that the table that is storing all the email addresses stay hash and stays secure, so nobody can access the table and then everyone will be fine and dandy. I say that, but there's always a chance that something fucked up might happen. And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's not safe and secure at all. But for me, personally, I'm okay with being on the application. Um, you know, like I said, I'm in a position where it's using an old company email address, so and I have no plans of actually updating to a new email address, plus, I don't post on that app. Anyway. Much like you

How I use my Reddit account. So we're good, we're Gucci, you know,

We stan, we stan I mean Blind as any social media account or platform. They're going to be assholes on it. There are a bunch of assholes. I mean, the majority of people that are used Blind are tech bro assholes.

All shade. So of course, you're gonna find some idiots on there. But I usually avoid that because I just like going to the top posts of the day and seeing what those are about. And then I really don't search for anything else on there. I know I've had a friend reach out to me and say that somebody posted my medium article about the discrimination and racism that I faced at my old employer and a lot of those comments weren't so great. But then again, if it's a bunch of people that are tech Bros.

**Jocelyn**  25:00  
And they are talking about discrimination and racism, chances are that

**Jocelyn**  25:06  
and if they're with my old company, chances are those comments aren't going to be so great, after all. So all in all, should we trust Blind? Should we continue to use Blind? Yeah, I feel as though you don't stop using an application until it gives you a reason to stop using it. And so far, I will say that Blind has helped me in terms of

**Jocelyn**  25:30  
in conjunction with levels that FYI, it has helped me to figure out what salary band I should be looking for,

**Jocelyn**  25:40  
for the position that I'm in, and all of those factors and, you know, it's really nice seeing that information, and almost real time from people who are also interviewing and going through the negotiation process and everything like that in real time. So I definitely see Blind as a resource, obviously, again, just like any social media

**Jocelyn**  26:00  
Your platform, use with caution.

And especially when it's when it's your work, email us with extreme caution. I will say there is an option to sign up with a quote unquote normal email address meaning like a Gmail, Yahoo emails, address, whatever. But it's read only, so you wouldn't be able to make any actual posts there. And I know there are other limitations like you wouldn't be able to go to like company specific sections of the website. Obviously, those are usually only for people that have

their email addresses as their verified work email addresses. But

other than that, I don't see anything wrong. I know that the people that replied on that post and CS career questions are also on the same page. I mean, as long as it doesn't give me any other breach or anything else that I should be worried about.

Then I feel like it's fine and like I said, the main thing

issue with that breach was that they were storing email addresses in plain text instead of hashing them. And if anybody else is great at system design, y'all can tell me if it's

if there's anything else to worry about, including their authentication system with their US patent, go ahead, email me, I don't know a lot. But that was my general understanding of it. And hopefully, you can keep on using Blind or lurking on Blind. Yeah, not using lurking because I work. I look on all social, all social media, but like Insta stories and Twitter. Let's be real.

All right. If you liked this episode, feel free to leave a like and a comment and review on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening to this episode because it really helps me out and all that great stuff. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, feel free to email me at VQ podcast at gmail dot

Calm also feel follow feel free See I can't speak this episode it was so hard for me to record you guys you don't even know um

follow the podcast on twitter at get cute podcast. You may also follow me on my public Twitter and my personal public Twitter not saying I have a private one again where it's really hard for me today and that is at so and so's Feel free to follow me because I do tweet about t shirt designs and all that stuff on there. So it will be a good time. I think honestly, I just need to get off of this microphone because it has been a rough episode.

I'm not sure why talking about Blind was so rough. I mean, I really enjoyed this episode. Hopefully this will spur all of you to start researching into Blind and other applications that you're using, especially if they say that they're giving you an anonymous feature. As you know, no one is truly anonymous on the on the Internet at all, but we like to think so.

You like to hope so. So yeah, I think that's all I have for you today. And I will see y'all next week. Bye.
