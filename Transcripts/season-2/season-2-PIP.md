**Jocelyn** (00:36):
Hi, this is Jocelyn and welcome to episode one of season two of Git Cute podcast. Holy shit. We're here. I'm back. You're here. Let's do this. How are y'all? Um, I know my last episode or the last episode of season one was me trying to help y'all out through a quarantine and this coven 19 pandemic that we have going on right now. I hope that y'all found that helpful. I really thought that that was a good episode to kind of end season one because I think that is the most dramatic ending that I could have. And you know, I am a Leo and drama is what I like. I don't like being in drama, but I like creating drama. That makes me sound kind of, um, I'm just going to leave that there and today we are going to be talking about how to beat a PIP.

**Jocelyn** (01:47):
I will admit the title is slightly clickbait-y. However, I am going to give you actual bullet points and advice that you will need. Unfortunately some of the advice you would need before you actually received a PIP. Um, but it's kind of how it, how it plays out now. Um, it's time for disclaimer, I now have to do this because of a situation that happened on Twitter weeks ago. But I feel as though I am going to add this to every episode from now on, at least in season two, just so we all know and we are clear. I am a software engineer. I like teaching people. I like giving back to people. That is the main reason why I started this podcast. However, I cuss in this podcast. I am a grown ass woman. So the way I present information may not be something that you like.

**Jocelyn** (02:47):
So this is your way out. If you don't agree with me cussing, you don't agree with something that I sad, yada, yada, yada. Um, I always take constructive criticism through email at gate Q, podcast.com or you can DM me on Twitter at, um, Git Cute podcast. I try not to do podcast things on my personal Twitter account just because I like the separation. Um, but if any of this makes you believe that I'm taking away from the information that's being presented, he think I'm a full on idiot. Feel free to pause, close the app wherever you're listening to this podcast, closed website, shut off RSS feed SIS. You don't got to listen. You don't have to follow you. Don't talk about it. You can just move on and I will move on to. So now with that being said, let's get in to the episode.

**Jocelyn** (03:41):
So the reason why I wanted to make an episode about a PIP is essentially a lot of my episodes I make about things that are going on in my life because I feel as though something, if you go through something then you are more knowledgeable about it. And usually when I go through something I kind of need to deep dive and go through a bunch of different resources to try to circumvent it. So I was put on a PIP at my last employer. I am currently unemployed. I am happily unemployed at the moment. So please know, Oh my goodness, what happened? Nothing was bad. It wasn't a bad separation. But I was put on a PIP and I failed the PIP, which ended up in me being terminated from my last position, which is not a bad thing. And I will explain this more later on the episode because it's kind of a doozy.

**Jocelyn** (04:31):
Um, it's just a lot. The answer may be obvious to some, but clearly not to all. When I see posts on CS career questions, freaking out what the prospects of being put on a PIP and thinking that if you're putting on a paper, essentially you are doomed, your career is doomed. Everything is terrible. What is going to happen to me? How will I ever code it again in a mega corporation? It's not true. Um, and yes, I know that the right is, he has career questions, is not necessarily the best, uh, group of people to be basing this information off of. But I do, um, go in and give advice to as many people as possible. Please do not try to go and find my Reddit account because a, um, if I use my personal Reddit account, I usually delete the responses to questions that I answer so nobody can trace back to me or I use several other accounts that I also delete the answers for after a certain amount of time.

**Jocelyn** (05:35):
So no, don't find me. Please. Thank you. Now nearly all of the advice who those people are, start looking for a job immediately. Um, it's not going to end well. You're going to get buyer, blah, blah, blah. And while that information isn't necessarily wrong, it is possible to beat a PIP. However, you need to have certain criteria already met for, to be your outcome, which is what I referenced in the beginning of this episode as theirs. There are some guidelines as you already need to have in place for a PIP to be successful. Now as far as the resources that I use for this episode, there are a couple of articles, and then I will also list the resources throughout the episode as well because I just want to be really transparent that a lot of this information is coming from me. But also I do research.

**Jocelyn** (06:20):
I write transcripts for my episodes, so I want to be as transparent about where I get the information as possible. So in the beginning, there are two articles that I referenced the most. Your boss put you on a personal improvement plan. Now what? By Michelle Costello for the daily muse and 17 mindblowing statistics on performance reviews and employee engagement by Meredith wholly for clear company. When I decided that I wanted to do this episode, honestly I had it in my mind at the beginning of my PIP, which was, mm. I want to say end of January is when that started. And then the PIP ended at the end of April. So in terms of length of PIP, cause normally at the company that I worked for, I believe they were 30 or 60 days. It was a very, very long PIP. And I'm unsure if the length of time was because of what happened to before the PIP that it got extended so long.

**Jocelyn** (07:15):
However, this is, this is what I have been given because I am a numbers person. You know, I immediately started researching for UpToDate statistics about pips, personal improvement plans, performance improvement plans. I've obviously seen things being noted as both somebody reached out to me on Twitter and said that it was, um, performance improvement plans. Um, and based on the research that I did after that, we, I believe that it can be used as both, but we do know the acronym Pitt and what it means. I wanted to know the following. I wanted to know percentage of people that experienced pips in their career, percentage of them that fail their pips and of those people that failed their pips, the percentage of them that had no trouble getting a job after the PIP. Because typically when I see people talking about pips, usually within tech, obviously these are the three core questions or topics that seem to come up over and over again.

**Jocelyn** (08:14):
And shockingly, the amount of statistical data regarding pips is pretty much nonexistent. There are more articles and statistics for employers about what to do when you have an employee on a PIP. Then there is for employees, which is at first kind of shocking. The more I thought about how a PIP is an antiquated process and documentation for human resources, the more it started to make sense. Here's a hot take for you, no matter how cool the company ended up working for is how much you believe that your manager loves you, how much you think that your skip levels manager loves you and how well documented and well presented this PIP or this process is going be to you. Remember that human resources is always there to protect the company and not to protect you when it comes to the company versus you. So keep that in mind.

**Jocelyn** (09:05):
The company and human resources is there ultimately to make sure the company doesn't get sued. Period. Going back to stats because of there was no statistical data for me to go for. I decided in a true Jocelyn flair to work off of my own sample group of one AKA me because that's all I had. So the number of times I experienced a PIP in my career, one just one percentage of times that I failed my PIP, a hundred percent doing great. I failed my PIP. Yes. Percentage of people that had trouble getting a job after their PIP 0%. Um, I haven't actually gotten a job after my PIP, honestly, it's only been a couple of weeks, so I'm kind of just chilling and trying to get my life together right now to get ready for the interview and application process. Although I have started interviewing and I've started the application process for a couple of companies already. Um, so how can this be, you say, isn't there a notion that after a PIP that suddenly you just are never going to find a job anymore? Well, I suppose I need to start explaining by how I got here.

**Jocelyn** (10:22):
So I'm trying to keep this as short as possible because a lot of the personal details regarding my PIP aren't necessarily important, but I have tried to pull out the points that are important for you to know. So step one, um, when I started at my company in 2018 June or July of 2018, one of those, when I started at the position, I had one manager whom I really, really liked. Um, the person that would eventually become a manager was my tech lead. He and I, there's this odd Bob vibes right away, but I'm kind of used to it. The previous job I came from, I, it was hellish to say the least. So, but I know how to keep it professional until it starts becoming a bit, uh, too much, which was not the situation that was going on at this job until much later, which I will get into.

**Jocelyn** (11:19):
So, um, I want to say like three or six months into my job, I was switched to my tech lead to be their employee. Um, I will say that also my manager, um, got a promotion. So that is why they needed me to be under him in terms of employee and that is when all the problems started for me. Um, I will also say that within this timeframe, another colleague came on am I really liked and he was also put under my manager as an employee and then within three months, quite literally three months he left. And I believe around that time I was thinking I probably should have left too. But you know, I am stubborn, really stubborn sometimes and I decided just to stay on. So there was a lot of back and forth between me and my manager. Um, I blame it on him not really knowing how to manage because he just received this promotion.

**Jocelyn** (12:24):
I was the very first employee that he had and prior to that he did not have any managerial training. He received most of the managerial training while I was already as employee and during that duration. Needless to say, I believe in June of 2019 I get my first official review because I happened to come in under the Mark for review for the end of 2018 and I got what the company noted as he's strong. So as strong as essentially average, really, um, you always want to get, uh, I don't know what this better than strong, strongest, I don't know, but better than strong and above is what you want to aim for in terms of compensation from bonuses. And that was great except he was saying that I barely got a strong, which is kind of odd to be like, Oh you did so well, you got to strong but you barely got there SIS like let's be clear.

**Jocelyn** (13:24):
You barely got it. Which, what, what am I supposed to say that? Uh, fucking thank you. I'll still take it cause that's a strong on paper. And so after that I were skipping along cause it happened in June or July and then August I went on vacation for two weeks and just to reset because I was getting really stressed out. Um, my manager was very micromanagy is just not a good, uh, vibe. Um, I was often found having to repeat myself with ideas or people not believing me with information that I had. And then like two or three days later when somebody is still working on the same issue, it turns out that it was right about it. And you know, it's just like, it was very mentally draining, very mentally draining. We're still going here. And so after I came back I thought that, you know, my mind was reset.

**Jocelyn** (14:15):
Everything was good because I wasn't in the office for two weeks. I wasn't in there for two weeks. So I thought that I had reset and would be good. I thought that maybe I was trying to starting to experience burnout, but that was not the case. Um, so I get back and then he presents me with a, an improvement plan. So an improvement plan at this company was different than a PIP. So an improvement plan in this instance is your, your baby PIP. Essentially it's just between you and your manager. HR doesn't see this, but it's still gets uploaded into like the database as far as your employee record. And these are the inmate outline things that they didn't like necessarily, um, about that. So I was very confused obviously from getting from a strong to a personal, I'm sorry, I, personal improvement and improvement plan within like two months, two or three months.

**Jocelyn** (15:15):
I wasn't understanding how that could be since I had just finished like a very huge project and was getting praised for that. And so at that time I kind of noticed that, Hey, I believe that they just want me to be out. So we're going to pause here because on Twitter you Git Cute podcasts and it was my little plug. I did tweet out and I did ask people if they had any questions about pips or myths about pips that they want known or don't want to talk about. So as you know, I got a few replies. I got a lot of replies from two people to be completely honest. But I want to pause here because I did say that I thought that they were just gathering the paperwork to get me out, which is factual. Um, somebody on Twitter did say that one of the myths is, you know, that, uh, most of us are at, we'll stay tonight, we'll companies.

**Jocelyn** (16:20):
So that means an employer can, uh, let you go for whatever reason, which is true kind of. Um, employer can let you go for any reason. However, if they don't have the documentation to back up the reason why bait are firing you, that opens up the company to a lawsuit. America, the United States is very lawsuit happy. And believe me, if an employee thought that they were let go for a wrong reason and they're in the company or the managers did not cross their T's and dot their eyes, they would become entangled in litigation, in a lawsuit from the former employee to the employer. This is why HR has these practices in place for managers that are paper trails to follow to make sure that it is known about troubles and manager had what troubles the employees had leading into your PIP, which is like the ultimate paper trail within a certain amount of timeframe for you to pass that or to fail that and then letting you go.

**Jocelyn** (17:20):
So I know somebody on Twitter said that it companies can just let you go, but it's kind of false. They need to actually have their paperwork to be able to let you go in and out will state, it's not fully just, okay, you're fired, goodbye dah, dah, dah. That's not how it happens here in the United States that anyway, because look, talk to somebody in HR that hasn't crossed their T's, they're dotting their I's and just ask them about litigation in lawsuits from former, I bet you would be shook. You hear me shook. So to go back to my story, that is what I believe what's happening and I still believe that was happening. So needless to say, I at first tried my hardest to address these issues. But then, um, and I didn't realize this until probably mid December that I was going through something that I had gone through before, um, on a smaller scale.

**Jocelyn** (18:22):
So I've always known I've had anxiety, I have been prone to anxiety attacks when I lose younger, gosh, maybe like 18, 19. I do get anxiety flare ups a lot. Um, I ha I have had panic attacks in the past, but none of them were nearly as bad as this. And so I found that during these months leading up to December that it was really hard for me to read. It was hard for me to retain information. Um, even I've written something down and re read that I couldn't retain that information. So in fact, that actually slowed down my production time and none of these things were really clicking for me. Like I didn't understand why I knew that I was feeling anxious when I had to go into the office. I knew I was taking more work from home days because that was just one less, uh, barrier for me to get to work into, try to be productive.

**Jocelyn** (19:12):
So come in mid December, it's still not getting any better and I'm at my lowest of lows mentally. So I go ahead and go to my primary physician, which I'm very thankful to have health insurance from my previous employer and to be able to have a general physician. So I went to her and I basically just, I had a breakdown in her office. I'm very fortunate that my GP is very understanding and knew immediately what was going on. She listened to me and she was the person that said, um, you need to go on short term disability.

**Jocelyn** (19:54):
As for the definition of short term disability, I got the best definition of this from an article called 16 questions. You never even realized you had about short term disability benefits by cat blue, a guard for the muse, they keep coming up a lot. That's pretty cool. So short term disability as defined by cat in this article is a type of insurance benefit in the United States that provide some compensation or income replacement for non-job related injuries or illnesses that render you unable to work for a limited period of time. I didn't even think about going for short term disability, but she wanted to start me on medication. I said yes because I couldn't think of any other way to get to just be able to function and we went through the process of getting the paperwork. I had to call HR and get that all set up.

**Jocelyn** (20:43):
Um, her, my doctor filling out the paperwork that her faxing it to the office and then I approved for six weeks of short term disability. It is important to note that I did receive either 80% to full compensation while I was on short term disability. And so my manager, his manager were made aware of the fact that I was on short term disability leave for six weeks. So if I was out from mid December to almost to late January, um, at one point my doctor almost wanted me to go into February, but I was like, that's too long. I might have been on medication. Now let's see how it works. After I came back from that short term disability, I was handed my PIP Denta,

**Jocelyn** (21:20):
which is Ooh, little, a little online. I think it's a little odd, but as I said before, employers are using or getting their ducks in a row, the paperwork is being filed. It is happening. So don't let them fool you SIS. Okay. At the PIP. So I was still kind of emotionally fragile at this point and um, for me in that situation, I just wanted the offer that was going to be less stressful for me. There were two options that my company gave me with my PIP option. One was going to be, you can just say no PIP SIS and you will get your severance package after X amount of days or whatever and they will keep you in touch with like, um, uh, services that they have set up for you to help find a job or services that they have for you to do training, whatever it is.

**Jocelyn** (22:25):
They, it was pretty good as far as what the company had in order and in means of supporting you if you wanted to take that route. And then also a means of supporting me if I wanted to take the PIP, obviously in the end I decided to take the PIP because at the time that was the less stressful thing for me to do. I was very worried about income at that point and making sure that, um, I have, I have, I have a cat, I have a child now, so I needed to make sure that we had a home and I had money to provide for me and my Luna and also, um, going through the PIP, that meant I had X amount of weeks of guaranteed income. Okay. I had guaranteed income. So a lot of this was just making sure that I was not stressed out and it was money motivated as well.


**Jocelyn** (23:31):
so NASA is, we're going to get into the bit where, um, I don't want to necessarily say what happened during my PIP. I will say that I tried my hardest in the beginning and then I just stopped trying. Like what else is there? Um, I emotionally, I could not do it. I could not bring myself to try any harder than I already had. Um, but what I will tell you is that what I did do for like the first two months of my PIP was working extremely well. And the reason that I know that it was working extremely well is because of the feedback that it was getting every week from my, well not my manager, but my fake manager in that time. Because during the time I managed manager went on a month long vacation and so I was reporting to a fake manager.

**Jocelyn** (24:24):
But you, it's convoluted, but you get the story. You understand what I'm saying? That's all it matters. So let me tell you the things that I did do in order to make the first half, two thirds of my PIP successful for me. Promise this works. The number one thing that you need in order to beat a PIP is to have a good manager. I did say twice in this episode, probably more that there are things that you cannot control, that there are things that you were going to need to have four even think you're getting a PIP in order to be to PIP. And this is the number one thing. And what I mean by having a good manager, I mean having a manager that is active and manager that is equally invested in your success because they know your success is their success. Somebody that wants to mentor you, somebody that is going to give you constructive criticism, but then also make sure that you are acknowledged for the good things that you're doing as far as contribution to the team and to the company.

**Jocelyn** (25:31):
I ain't gonna say nothing but my last manager. But here's some things that I know are the signs of a good manager. Ensure that they have been giving you weekly one on one. So news of a PIP would not be coming out of thin air. So in this instance, one-on-one is a weekly sit down meeting with your manager. It doesn't necessarily have to be in person. It can obviously be over zoom or whatever else you're using for your corn teen work at home situation, but one on one meetings are important to discuss your progress with your manager depending on how many employees your manager actually has to manage. It's possible for your one Oh one to be once every two weeks, but it should definitely not be more than three and definitely not a month. That is showing me that the manager has too many employees or they're not focusing on the police are focused on other things, but you need a manager to carve out that time at least once a week or once every two weeks in order to have communication with your manager.

**Jocelyn** (26:32):
But the communication definitely should not be micromanagement. Another thing managers need to be rooting for you and willing to help you through the PIP process. For me, I did have that sort of support going through my PIP from, not my manager because he was gone for an entire month, but from his skip level and then from my fake manager as well. They were very um, nice. They were checking in on me. I was checking on them. They made themselves available as resources for me to reach out to them if there was any kind of roadblock in necessarily like in my work or if somebody from this team wasn't responding. All of those things were great and I also noticed that HR gave my manager and the skip levels very specific things to say. During the PIP there was actually a transcript that they had to follow word for word during the PIP which only further supports my idea that a PIP is an H R tool for paper trail management, which means they are trying to not be sued.

**Jocelyn** (27:38):
How many more times? We'll have to tell you how many more times. Third thing for knowing you have a good manager is that they don't get defensive of constructive feedback from you. It's very important that a manager and employee partnership is a two way street. As much as your manager is expected to give you feedback, you can also, and you should also give your manager feedback. I'm not saying that you have to air any grievances that you have experienced on the team or with them or anything of that nature, but that is expected of them. And if your manager doesn't get any constructive feedback about how they're managing people, then how will they become a better manager and to grow. So if the manager immediately becomes defensive, this should be seen as a red flag. If you're not supposed to be defensive when you're receiving constructive feedback from them, then they should be held to the same standard.

**Jocelyn** (28:27):
If you have a good manager, let's move on to step number two, which is to document everything. Everything. When I am, uh, when my serotonin levels are high, when they are good, revive in my anxiety is low. I am, I guess I'm type a, I'm type a and just saying I'm type a. So I do have a productivity journal that I like to use and fill out during my day to day when I am at work. And I'm essentially just lists out tasks that I need to complete that day. And, um, the time that it took me to complete those tasks. And then also I write notes to myself about why this didn't get done that day, which is really important because it's pretty much a written log of what you've done with timestamps. And I also, um, decided to screenshot a lot of the things because in one section of my PIP I noticed that there was a screenshot of my GitHub activity to show that I had quote unquote not produced enough.

**Jocelyn** (29:28):
However, I will say this, that the timeframe they were speaking of, I was working on a very large scale Jenkins migration. And if you have worked in Jenkins and you know about the scripting and if your scripts aren't stored in a repo like ours weren't and are just stored locally on Jenkins, that you're not submitting any code for dad. But I digress. I also started taking screenshots of my get hub chart to show what I had been doing each day, how many commits I had been making, et cetera, et cetera. I'm making sure that I'm putting those into the document that I had written. There were weekly reports that showed that I was tackling each section of the PIP that they had outlined for me and what I was doing to tackle that. And then when it came to my one on ones with my fake manager, we would go over that.

**Jocelyn** (30:20):
He would say, he agreed, this is great, and then he maybe he would add more things that I didn't have there. I didn't document that he noticed and then we would go on. It was signed off, it was Gucci. So that worked for about two months, y'all. That was, it was going very, very well. Another thing that I also say that is very important is to find a mentor. Please find a mentor. And I'm not saying a mentor necessarily for moving up in the company or anything because that's not what we're worried about at this point. Once you receive a PIP, you're worried about just staying at the company. So I was really fortunate that I had coworkers that were very active in certain groups that my company had and connected me to somebody that was a recruiter and they were able to give me very good feedback about how my situation was not normal and pretty much outline what I needed to do to make sure that I was successful.

**Jocelyn** (31:13):
My PIP, they told me to document everything, which I already was doing, but they said to document it even more. I started forwarding my documentation to him as well. I for him to proofread to make sure that everything was good. I also had weekly phone meetings with him to Aero, any grievances that I didn't necessarily want to say to like my manager or anything at that point, and he just kind of talked me through it and gave me really good advice on how to circumvent those situations. So I will say that he was invaluable to me through that experience and I'm very, very happy that I was able to find somebody that I trusted. But I would say to find a mentor, you don't necessarily have to tell them that you're on a PIP. Just say that you are noticing that you're maybe on an improvement plan or something of that nature and see if they have any advice for you as far as to help you get through this.

**Jocelyn** (32:03):
Now, all of these tips are based on the information that you get when you receive your documentation. Usually when you receive a PIP, you should extra highlight on should because not all managers do this. Apparently I have talked to people where this has not happened, so this is what happened to me. This is my own personal situation. You should receive a detailed outline of the benchmarks that you need to hit by the end of the pips time period in order to be considered a pass or fail. Again, in my experience with the process, I had a weekly meeting with my fake manager and to make sure I was hitting my benchmarks or if I needed any help with the tasks that I was assigned. And again, like I said, that was very, very helpful. But within your PIP, everything is very, very detailed and shows what you need to do.

**Jocelyn** (32:52):
I was thankful for that as well because it gave a pretty good breakdown. Now if you do everything that I say as far as documentation, finding a mentor, making sure that everything is just good with your manager, finding a good manager, having a good manager, then you should and all intents and purposes be able to pass your PIP. Right? Right. You know, sometimes if you don't have a good manager or you just know that it's a situation where they are just trying to get you out, then that is when you want to start job hunting. And like I said before, most of the time on CS career questions, people are just saying start looking for a job. They're not wrong. Once you get a PIP, you don't necessarily have to start filling out applications, but you can start networking. You can start looking on Twitter to see what companies have openings or trying to gauge the reaction and things of that nature.

**Jocelyn** (33:51):
Um, actually, even when I am with a company, I, my motto is to never close a door. Even if I'm with a company and everything's going very, very well, I'll always leave that line open with a recruiter or whomever, just in case maybe something changes with and I am looking for a change or shift, then I know that I have somebody I can go back to and see what's going on. So it's always good to be networking and having those lines open anyway while you have a job, even if things are going on. But when you get a PIP, you want to kind of amp that up, amp it up if it's not going to cause you additional stress. That's very important. Um, I will say that during my PIP I had not the best, uh, ideas of drying to us, study for interviews and then also interview with places like Google and Amazon who have materially difficult interviews and you know, don't be mean, don't do that, but definitely get ready.

**Jocelyn** (34:49):
And you know, if you can tell toward the end of your PIP period that things aren't going to go well. And then chances are it's pretty good to start brushing up on your coding interview challenges. I did tell y'all that I did ask people on Twitter about some questions they have with pips and I'm going to address these. I may have already addressed some of these questions in the episode, but um, let's just go over them again to make sure that everybody is clear. So the first question is, when should a PIP be a nudge to consider a different position?

**Jocelyn** (35:26):
I just went over this. I'm a PIP should be a nudge to consider a different position when you know that you were already unhappy in the job in the first place and you were only staying stability and money. That is when I think a PIP could be a nudge to consider a different position, whether that position beyond a different team within the company or maybe outside of the company. I definitely think that's when you should start considering for a different position. And another question is, presuming a PIP goal for me is improved performance in your current position, what strategies should the PIP offer? Who should we reach out to for support? Which resources can we use? So I believe that a PIP goal being improved performance in your current position is too vague for it to be an actionable PIP goal. Um, usually I would expect the PIP goal to have that as like maybe a header and then for it to list out specific instances like measurable instances where your performance can be improved because you can't tell me to improve my performance if you don't have numbers to back that up because you have to sign a PIP because it is a document for HR.

**Jocelyn** (36:36):
I in that meeting, I would need them to revise that PIP for me. And I actually did that because we read through the PIP together and I went line by line and I told them things that needed to be changed to removed or something that needed to be actionable because this is something that's going to be with you at that company for the lifetime of that company. And you need it to be correct. So the very first thing is I would need actual measurable instances rather than just improved performance. In your current position as far as what strategies should the PIP offer? Again, actionable ones, who should we reach out to for support? Which resources can we use? I did say this, that your manager and his skip level and your current team should be ports as far as getting your tasks and deliverables done as far as like emotional support, always go to your friend, your partner, your family should be there for you. Which resources can we use?

**Jocelyn** (37:37):
I'm your manager or your skip level should be able to provide you additional resources for you to use with regarding your PIP. Um, another resource that I mentioned as well is to find an internal mentor, maybe an outside mentor that can um, walk you through that. Another question, what creative strategies would y'all recommend for digging deeper than just work more and harder? I'm thinking of when my manager bluntly and compassionately instructed me to buy a nice pair of noise canceling headphones using the desk budget provided by HR. I don't know if I can give a creative strategy. That's just so weird. I mean,

**Jocelyn** (38:15):
I feel like,

**Jocelyn** (38:16):
and honestly without the context of which this was said, I can't give much thought to this, but for your manager to tell you to buy noise canceling headphones using the desk budget, I think that's kind of nice. I think that that was sort of nice of him to tell you, Hey, I think it was maybe his way of saying, I think maybe you're being district, like you're getting distracted and if you buy a nice pair of noise canceling headphones, you don't even have to pay for it. You can just use the budget that the company provides you then that might help you in terms of that. That's the way I'm taking that, that, but of course I believe that you took it in a different way because you said your manager bluntly and compassionately instructed you to. Um, but as far as strategies that is really dependent on the person, I'm the type of person that gets distracted very easily and it's not necessarily just sound, it could just be like with another task.

**Jocelyn** (39:13):
I'm that type of person that can get diverted from that. But I have mentioned in and season one episode where I love the Pomodoro method and that's what my productivity journal that I was speaking about earlier as far as documenting what you're doing on your PIP is used for and the Pomodoro method, especially for somebody where my attention gets drawn to different places sometimes it's so nice and it's really amazing for that. So I definitely suggest finding a productivity journal that you'd like. I will leave a link to the productivity journal and the show notes of this episode that I use. I'm not sponsored by them. I just happen to like that the most. It's pocket size. It's very straightforward and to the point and it is the best thing that I have used outside of questions, there are more comments here and I think I mentioned this in the episode too.

**Jocelyn** (40:08):
If the company sure they want to fire you, they can simply fire you and avoid the headache of administering a PIP. The vast majority of us are at will employees. Like I said before, yes, the vast majority of us, our at will employees and typically I have seen in companies that they don't outright fire you unless you have committed something. I'm pretty grievous against their set code of conduct and guidelines and the company handbook. And also perhaps you've already had warnings for a specific thing which would be in this case the improvement plan and the PIP. So while that is true that most of us are at will employees, I will say this again to reiterate to the end of days that a PIP is for HR, not so much for you. If you beat a PIP, congratulations. It's very doable. It's not impossible, but also know that that's going to stay on your record as well.

**Jocelyn** (41:03):
And um, yeah, just know that. And if you think you can still be happy with your current manager and that current team after the PIP, by all means go for it. You may even want to move to a different team after that, but pips are definitely to keep the company from getting sued. Another comment, I've been on a PIP before. I was straight up not doing well at my job. Hey, same, same, same, same. If it happens to you, it can be hard to swallow. Know that you're still a good person, a good worker. It's just the wake up call that you've been doing what you've been doing isn't working. Something has to change. Um, yes. But also that blame isn't necessarily always on the person that's receiving the PIP. Of course I would be a fool to not acknowledge that I wasn't doing well at my job.

**Jocelyn** (41:44):
I obviously wasn't doing well at my job, but I also had underlying mental health issues at the time, um, because of my job. So that was very hard for me. But I will say that if you don't have a good manager, I'm really, really thinking this home. If you don't have a good manager or a support system at work, it can be equally, there's fault as well because your manager is supposed to help you succeed if you want to succeed as well. So it's definitely a balance there. A reminder gaining a PIP does not mean that your career is over. It does not mean that you're never going to work as a software engineer for our company ever again. There's this myth going around that having a PIP means that when you're going to apply for another company and that they are going to bad mouth you and that you'll never be able to get a job again.

**Jocelyn** (42:31):
That is simply false, but not only is it simply false, it's also illegal in many places in the United States, an employer cannot badmouth you unless something grievous has happened. Usually it's a yes or no question as to if you want to hire that person again. Now, in my PIP, it outlined that if I were to fail the PIP, the only thing that they would be giving to other employers when they do and a reference check is the salary that I had there and for how long I worked there. That's it. That's all. Now this gives you a blank slate. However you want to tell the truth about what happened with your next company. Don't lie about the reason why you left your company. Say that it just wasn't a good fit with the manager and I'm looking for another opportunity where my manager and I can work as one or yada, yada, yada, something, something, something.

**Jocelyn** (43:18):
I know you guys can make something up on the spot just to remember that if you think you're going to get a PIP, having one on one with your manager, your manager doesn't necessarily have to be the ones that set up the one on ones, but you can set up the one-on-ones yourself. It's for a weekly vibe check at your job and remember if you are on a PIP now or if you fail a PIP or even if you pass your PIP, congratulations. This is not a benchmark against you. It does not mean that you are bad worker. As someone who nicely tweeted that at me said, it doesn't mean any of those things. It just means that now you have a benchmark for how you continue being a badass software engineer or a technologist and everything will be fine. I promise.
