Everyone. Welcome back to another episode of get cute. How exciting this episode I am going to be talking to you. Lovely people about how I solve wheat code problem is and how I think this is the fastest way to come to a solution that you're able to submit on the site. Before we get into that, however, I have to have my disclaimer. I do cuss in this podcast. I may not present information in a way that is palatable for you. So if you feel that way, this is your way out unsubscribed. You can, undownload my episodes. You don't have to support me in any way whatsoever, but what I asked you not to do is to tone police me. However, I am open to general critique and I take that well, but tone policing is not the way to go now with that being said, let's get into it.

**Jocelyn** (01:06):
So a few days ago, I tweeted on my personal Twitter at so and so's and I talked about how I had solved my first leak code problem, a little history about this. It was not my first time being on late code. Typically I would get really frustrated and, and I wouldn't even submit an answer. I just kind of left it and close the website and that'd be that. But a few days ago I did tweet that I actually solved a problem and it was an easy problem. And that's where I needed to start off with. I need to start off with easy problems and the fact that I solved one and I submitted it and it was accepted was like an moment for me. So that was really exciting. Now I think the issue with my tweet is that people assumed that I am a bad at coding.

**Jocelyn** (02:02):
Be bad at Lea code C bad at studying or D all of the above. When in reality, I, I pride myself on my problem solving skills. It just, my problem solving skills alone is what got me into my coding boot camp. And that's what makes me a good software engineer, because at the end of the day, that's all we're doing in our day to day. Jobs is problem solving on either smaller or large scales. So I have talked about this on Twitter, and I just wanted to be a little more transparent about it, but I was diagnosed with PTSD at the beginning of this year in January, after having to take almost two months off for short term disability leave because of how I was being treated by my manager at my last company and the process really over the almost two years working there really fucked up my self esteem, all spectrums.

**Jocelyn** (03:01):
And it was obviously impacting me the most of my work and coding, which is where doctors determined that swear my PTSD was sending from. It has taken me almost seven full months to get back to the point of being able to open an IDE or leak code and be able to work through a problem without stopping after maybe five minutes of just getting frustrated or anxious or just full on crying or having a panic attack. I still have a really long way to go, because mind you, two weeks before I even tweeted about solving my week code problem, I was still having anxiety and panic attacks and talking to my mentor about things of that nature, not really understanding of how I was going to move forward, thinking about maybe I need to actually quit software engineering, because I don't know if I can do it again, but at least now I think that I can make it through the job hunt in the interviewing process, which is what I'm currently doing right now. However, I am like, I sing. This is about how to solve the code HackerRank and really any problem that might crop up in coding your job life, maybe whatever let's get into it. So I lean up in this episode, there will be no resources because for total transparency, bitch, I am the resource of this episode. This is how I tackle problems. I did not Google anybody. I did not ask anybody any questions. Okay. So let's get into it.

Today's episode has been brought to you by audible. Audible is the leading provider of spoken word entertainment and audio books ranging from bestsellers to celebrity memoirs, news, business, and self development. I've been using it to reread a song of ice and fire books by George RR Martin. And I'm so glad that I have the audio book to get through them this time. So I won't have to read the digital versions on my iPhone, like how I got through them. The first time audible is giving gatekeeper listeners a free 30 day trial and a free audio book. Yes, for real, just visit audible trial.com forward slash get cute again. Visit audible trial.com forward slash cute today for your free 30 day audible trial. Now let's get back to the episode.

**Jocelyn** (05:25):
The number one thing that I do when I openly code, I pick a problem. I approach it as if I were pair programming when somebody or actually prayer program with someone else. I think this way has actually gotten me into a better mindset for interviewing. It has helped me be able to toss my ideas back and forth because when you have ideas about solving a problem, you have to find the right words and the right terminology to get that across to the other person. This person that I did that with yesterday was my dear friend, Bob, who you met through my PC building episode. And he and I, we solve problems very differently, I believe. And so, so the way I'm thinking, I have to explain it to him like, Hey, you know, you do this here, dah, dah, dah. And he'll be like, what do you mean?

**Jocelyn** (06:21):
And that, and that's the discourse that you need to have with somebody. Explain it to me like I'm five, but not in a conduit way. Explain it to me how I need to know to understand the material. And I think that's the best way to get through it. Second thing, take a deep breath because this is not life or death, even though it feels like it. Even if it's in a interview situation, everything is okay, whether you solve a problem or not. It's not a big deal. I promise you just keep repeating that to yourself. Step three, break the problem down into small chunks and then Iterable pieces. So I've noticed that most problems are worded really poorly on Lee code. So it will take a couple of minutes to figure out what the person writing the problem actually wants. So this is where it gets into a good idea with your pair programmer, because you can run your ideas past your pair programmer to see if you're correct correcting irritation in the interpretation of the verbiage.

**Jocelyn** (07:25):
And if you both agree on it, then you can move forward from there. And once that usually happens, I write down with our agreed interpretation of the problem in plain English, for me in a notebook. Another thing that I should note is that I usually solve and write my code in a notebook before I start coding or do anything of that. It's just easier for me. It helps me memorize. It helps me understand a little bit better than just fully typing it on a computer step four, figure out a brute force solution to the problem. And plain English do not code. I think this is something that's so detrimental to us as software engineers is that you do not need to hop directly into code. You need to plan first. So what I do, yeah is I talk it over with my friend or my pair programmer.

**Jocelyn** (08:18):
This will more than likely be a back and forth conversation, which includes the confines of the program. Usually like return type, because that may involve some data structure changing and casting usually. I really don't pay attention to time constraints normally. And by time constraints, I mean, in this case, the amount of time they want you to solve a problem and not the kind of constraint of which the program has to run and pass all the test cases, because obviously that needs to be met or else you can't submit it. And it won't go green for you. Step five, code it. Okay. So this can be the really hellish part, but it's also a really fun part. It's usually really fun because the language that you're completing and the challenge and will make it easier or harder for you. For instance, while my friend Bobby and I were solving the threesome integer problem on leak code, which I will link in the show notes below, if you are interested in tackling that problem, because please email me or tweet at me your solutions, because I would love to see what y'all have done in Java, please.

**Jocelyn** (09:19):
In Java, we realized I'm one of the test cases that we hadn't properly solved for Duplo kits. So this problem initially said, you need to find three integers and a list of arrays that bring you to the sum of zero and you need to return the answers and a list of arrays, which makes sense since that is a data structure that you started off with, right? Yeah. Mari Java. So what we noticed is that our Boolean flag was failing to always true and in a secondary, if statement that we had, and we had no idea why it was defaulting to true, always until we realized that the collection lists method of dot contains, compares objects, references, and not object values. Some of you are going to be like, Oh my God, Jocelyn, that's so obvious. Well, you know what? Sometimes it's not obvious when you're not doing algorithmic problems in your day to day job.

**Jocelyn** (10:19):
So it was a simple oversight on our part, but it really shot the competitor part of our algorithm solution in the foot. And we had to take an extra, I believe, 10 or 15 minutes to get that nailed down. Step six, refactor for efficiency. Once you have solved it and you have it passing all the test cases that leak code has is before your summit now is when you can look at your algorithm and figure out where you could get some much needed time back or out memory allocation back to you. You need to have a far leap. There is there another way to iterate over this without having it, do you really need to iterate over it all? Do you really need to have another data structure they're allocating more memory than necessary? You cannot get better as a software engineer and as a coder, if you can look back at your work and make it better, no one writes great code on the first go. The code that Bobby and I wrote was absolutely horrendous on the first pass, but we got it down to about five clean lines of code and one method. And no, that is not in reference to uncle Bob's book. We don't stand him in this house. We don't support you buying his book or whatever. I'm just saying clean code because it's easily readable. Take that as you want,

**Jocelyn** (11:35):
Step seven, get through as many of them as you can in a day without stressing yourself out. Now, this is a slightly problematic take for me to have, especially because I don't agree with the grinding and mindset that a lot of people that are coming out of college or that are just trying to be hired at thing companies. And for people that don't know what thing is failing our companies and the tech sector like Facebook, Airbnb, Apple.

**Jocelyn** (12:09):
God, what are the other ones? Google Netflix. There's more now, but those are the five main ones. And so, because that mindset is out there because of the companies are setting that mindset with their rigorous screening results, which I have talked about at length, how that is a really bad way of gatekeeping and keeping people that are actually talented out and people that can just memorize algorithms in. Sorry, not sorry. I do think that it's good to keep your mind sharp and to keep your mind still going in that algorithm phrase. I know it's really hard, especially when you get into a software engineer, job and algorithms rarely come up like that in jobs, depending on what you're doing. I have been a software engineer in the financial sector for the better part of three years, with four years total experience in the career field.

**Jocelyn** (13:09):
And I'm telling you right now on my day to day job, as a job at engineer doing middleware that now algorithms never came up. Nobody ever asks me to do a bubble sore at work just doesn't happen. But that being said, I think that maybe you should do one or two a day maximum, maximum, absolutely maximum. Don't push yourself to do that. If it makes you feel really anxious or you're just super uncomfortable, honestly, up until a few days ago, it was zero. I had tried to intermittently do them over the past couple of years and just could not wrap my head around it or find myself any good space to attempt them. But now just doing one easy problem, maybe every other day gives you a sense of confidence. That is absolutely paramount, slowly build momentum. I highly suggest going through the series of problems where entering one snowballs into another and grows in complexity as well. So the other problem before the threesome problem was the to some problem. And so these problems build on top of each other. And typically if you've solved the easy one solving the medium will be a little bit easier and solving the hard one will be a little bit easier from there. It gives, it gives you a sense of confidence, just like do practicing everyday does when it comes to tackling the rest of them.

**Jocelyn** (14:40):
As much as I disagree with how the tech industry currently conducts their technical screenings, interviews, grinding, leak, code HackerRank, and other algorithmic problem solving sites is how you get your foot in the door to a lot of these forward thinking. I'm doing air quotes, which you can't see me doing that tech companies. If I, someone with PTSD can manage to drag myself through this, I want you to think of how much I struggled and used me as a source of inspiration to get yourself through this as well. I do want to also remind you that there are companies out there that do not interview this way, and it might be worth the effort to find companies that do that, because I do know that that's what I'm doing on my current job search as well. And you know, you are more than your code and there are other companies out there that are not paying that will allow you to become a great software engineer as well.

The end of the episode, as always, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to email me@thegetcutepodcastatgmail.com or if you want to tweet at me and said, that's fine. My personal Twitter is at so and so's and the get cute Twitter is get cute podcast. I am now actually accepting PayPal donations through the get cute podcast website, which is get cute podcasts.com or you could just directly donate to me@thegetcutepodcastatgmail.com through PayPal. If you enjoy this content, feel free to leave me a five star review wherever you listen to podcasts, Apple podcasts, Google music, Spotify, Stitcher, wherever. The reviews really helped me a lot and they drive me up the charts. And that would be so great if you could do that for me, please. And thanks. I do have some news, the black lives matter CSS shirt that was designed by James T. Green has officially ended the sale of it has ended.

**Jocelyn** (16:40):
And at the end of it, we have raised over 14,000 plus dollars to be donated to various LGBTQ plus charities. And I am so amazed that tech tutor it has pulled together to do that. I knew we were a bunch of nerds that love t-shirts, but y'all have really gone above and beyond to show that you appreciate the black lives matter movement. And I cannot thank you enough. I will, of course, keep you up to date. If there are any other items or fundraisers available to donate through the black lives matter movement. This is still not over. We are still protesting and fighting against police supremacy every single day. And I appreciate y'all supporting black Americans and also supporting me through this very hellacious time. And I think that's it. I think that's the end of the episode. Thank you so much for listening. I really appreciate it. And I hope to see y'all next time.
